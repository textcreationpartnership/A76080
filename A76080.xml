            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Apoſtle Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the fourth of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> exhorting all Chriſtians to walk worthy of the Vocation whereunto they were called, and to behave themſelves as beſeemed brethren; wiſheth them with all lowlineſſe and meekneſſe, with long ſuffering and patience, to bear one with another in love: And uſeth a forceable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, to move them to brotherly kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Becauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there is but one body and one spirit and one hope of Salvation:</hi> We all worſhip one God, we are all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to him with one Baptiſme, and we all hope for one and the ſelf-ſame glory: Therefore as there is but one Lord, one faith, one Baptiſme; ſo be ye alſo of one minde, live in love, and keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of Peace. If ever there was need of this Exhortation, there is now ſingular uſe of it, eſpecially in this diſtracted Nation wherein we live. For the diviſion of a Kingdome is the ruin of it: the diviſion of a family deſtroys it: the diviſion between brethren brings a confuſion amongſt them. It hath ever bin obſerved, That diverſity of judgement &amp; opinion hath made a difference in affection. The difference between the <hi>Jews</hi> &amp; the <hi>Samaritans</hi> in points of Religion, made the Diſciples deſire, That fire might come down from heaven to end that controverſie.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:158510:3"/>The difference between us and the Papiſts, and the diverſity of opinions between us, made them, becauſe they could not bring down fire from heaven, fetch it out of hell, to blow up the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and becauſe that had not the deſired effect, and the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of opinion ſtil remaining, makes the difference of their affection from us ſo great, that nothing can expiate their indignation againſt us, but the utter internetion and deſtruction of us all; and this and this only, next unto our own ſins, is the cauſe of all thoſe fatall calamities this miſerable kingdome is now imbroyled with. And therefore, all care and diligence among brethren, ſhould be uſed to get a right underſtanding one of another, and to move them to bear one with another, and ever to call to mind the ſaying of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Lot, Gen.</hi> 13. <hi>Let not us contend together, for we are brethren.</hi> I am moſt aſſured, if there were a right underſtanding of the differences that are now among brethren, there could not be ſuch bitter expreſſions one againſt another, and ſuch alienation of affection as is now too frequent and too well known to the common enemy. We are commanded, <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lies in us, to be in peace with all men, Rom.</hi> 12.18. And the fruits of diſcord are ſet down in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of the <hi>Galathians</hi> verſe 15. <hi>If</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>ye bite and devoure one another, take heed ye be not conſumed one with another,</hi> and in the 20. <hi>verſe. Hacred</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>varience, emulation, ſtrife, &amp;c. and envyings are of the fleſh, and they that do ſuch things ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God.</hi> A double miſery follows thoſe that do theſe things, miſery here, and miſery hereafter, it excludes men out of heaven. The contemplation of the ſad condition, that will inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably come upon that Land, Kingdome, and Church, where thoſe variances and heart-burnings are, and where there is ſuch diverſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of opinions, and by reaſon of them, ſuch difference in affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, put me chiefely upon this imployment, to ſee and try, if by any poſſible means, I could, by ſhewing wherein the difference between the brethren lyeth, be an inſtrument of a good accord amongſt them: reſolving with my ſelf by Gods aſſiſtance whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever others do, to obſerve to the uttermoſt of my abilities, the royall Law, <hi>Jan.</hi> 2.8. I do conceive, that if there were a right underſtanding one of anothers opinions, the world would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der there ſhould be ſuch invectives in every pamphlet one againſt another, and ſuch varience among thoſe that are joyned together
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:158510:3"/>and that with nigheſt relations. The truth is, the miſ-underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of each others opinions and the miſ-priſian of each others intentions, is the onely cauſe of this diverſity of affection which to the diſhonour of God and of our holy profeſſion, and indeed to the diſgrace of Chriſtian Religion, every where too much ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it ſelf. And therefore as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaid unto <hi>Lot,</hi> ſo ſay I to all thoſe that love the truth in ſincerity and wiſh the Peace of <hi>Zion;</hi> Let not us contend, eſpecially with evill language, for we are bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; we have one father, we worſhip one God, we have one light, one truth, one way. And this I profeſſe to all the world, That I contend not for victory, but for that ancient light, the faith once delivered unto the Saints, <hi>Jude</hi> 3. For that truth <hi>which we have heard from the beginning,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>for the old way,</hi> verſe 6. <hi>The way the truth and the life, Joh.</hi> 14. and for the honour of that Church againſt which the gates of hell can never prevaile; in the which theſe are all thoſe undeceiveable marks, as are able for ever to declare her to be built upon the foundation of <hi>Peter,</hi> in which the Goſpell of Jeſus Chriſt is purely and ſincerely both preached and beleeved, and where the Sacraments are rightly adminiſtred, and in the which there is the true invoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, and all other requiſites that make her a true Church; and from which there is no juſt cauſe of ſeparation. That I have dedicated this Treatiſe to no man, nor ſought the patronage of any Authority, no mortall creature I preſume will blame me, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Reaſons. For writing in defence of the Prerogative Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of Kings, againſt Papall Uſurpation; I dedicated my book unto the King of great <hi>Britaine, France,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſuppoſing my ſelf ſafe under his protection, whoſe honour and imperiall dignity I maintain: but all men know, what miſery to the ruin of me, my wife, and many ſmall children came upon me by it, through the power and exorbitant authority of the Prelates: ſo that for my duty and Loyalty to the King, I had a priſon for my reward, and the ſcornes and contumelies of the world to comfort me in it. And when I moſt humbly petitioned his highneſſe, complaining againſt the injuſtice done me, and moſt ſubmiſſively ſupplicated his Majeſty (who was the <hi>Caeſar</hi> to whom onely I could then appeal) that he would be pleaſed to grant me one of theſe humble requeſts, either That his Majeſty would be pleaſed, but for one houre to give me a hearing of my juſt defence; or if
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:158510:4"/>that could not be granted, That at leſt he would then grant me that liberty in his Kingdome, that he denied not to Crows and Kites and other Vermine, that I might provide for my young ones; and if his highneſſe would not be pleaſed to condeſcend unto either of the former juſt demands, That then he would give me leave to depart the Kingdome, and to go into any other Country where I might enjoy my Liberty and provide for my poore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed family. I am moſt aſſured there was never a more equall Petition put up to any Prince in the world, yet his Majeſty vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed not to yeeld unto any of theſe my requeſts, nor to any other Petition put up either by my poor diſtreſſed wife or calamitous children; ſo that without any wrong unto his Majeſty, I may truely ſay, That <hi>Paul</hi> found more favour from a Heathen Roman <hi>Caeſar,</hi> then I had from a Chriſtian King, the defender of the faith. After I ſaw all poſſibility of releefe was now taken from me, I writ my Apologie to the Biſhops themſelves, diſcovering unto them their unjuſt proceedings in their Courts, and their unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dealings towards my ſelfe, and gave them my reaſons of all I ſpake, without any offenſive language and without any purturbation of Spirit; and Dedicated this my Book to the Lords of his Majeſties Privie Councell expecting aide and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe from them, and indeed I had no hope of ſuccour from any other, nor knew none to whom I could better apply my ſelf, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly imploring their patronage; but they, as it is well knowne, of Patrons became my unjuſt Judges, and after they had made me a ſpectacle to Men and Angels, and expoſed me to the ſcorne and ludibry of the world, ſent me into baniſhment, where I lived a living death and a dying life, and ſuffered ſuch intolerable miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of all ſorts, as would exceed belief to relate; and I am moſt conſident, if all the particulars were truly known, the world ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard the like, and there I had ended my dolefull life, had not God of his infinite mercy called this Parliament, and put into their hearts to redeem me from my capacity; for the which incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable favour, I do, as of duty I am ever bound, profeſſe my ſelfe to the laſt drop of my blood to be their ſervant in the Lord, and in all their moſt juſt and honourable imployments; I hope, with all fidelity to anſwer to the expectation of the world, and ſhall in life and death ſhew my ſelf to be one, that without all by-reſpects ſhall ever aime at the glory of God, the honour of them and my
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:158510:4"/>Country, and the common good of all: and ſhall never by Gods aſſiſtance do any thing in their concernments, that ſhall be unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming a Man and a Chriſtian. Now becauſe by my ſad experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, I found that I could neither from King nor Nobles have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, I reſolved never any more in Gods matters, to ſhroud my ſelf under any covert but Divine Providence, and that, I with an aſſured confidence promiſe my ſelf, eſpecially when I now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the prerogative royall of the King of Saints, &amp; King of Kings, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Who is our Lawgiver, upon whoſe ſhoulders the government of his Church is laid, who is the wonderfull Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, the Prince of peace;</hi> whoſe dignity and roialty in all this diſpute between me and Mr. <hi>Walter Montague,</hi> I have to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt of my power maintained, under the ſhadow of whoſe wings I have ever found there is only ſafety; whoſe bleſſed aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in all calamities, they that truſt in him, may be moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of. His patronage now and his defence, is my ſhield, whoſe cauſe and the honour of whoſe kingdome at this time I contend for. And howſoever, in all my life, in all humane learning, I was never ſo wedded to my own reſolves, but upon better reaſon I could eaſily be divorced from them, yet in Gods matters, if an Angell ſhould come from Heaven and teach me that, that there were another way to happineſſe, then by that new and living way, the blood of Jeſus Chriſt, who was the Lambe ſlaine from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, I would count him <hi>Anathema.</hi> Or if an Angel ſhould tell me there were a new way of worſhipping God, and ſerving him, then that which God himſelf hath ſet down in his holy Word, I would account him accurſed; for I have learned to believe God and Faith upon their word and bond, without any either Angelicall or Humane reaſon, or the authority of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels and Fathers: and whatſoever I finde a warrant in Gods Word for, I have learned to cleave cloſe to it againſt all humane reaſon, ſuppoſing ſuch men none of Gods, nor Faiths, trueſt friends that will not believe them upon their own word and bond, except they have reaſon, humane authority, Councels, and Fathers, and vaine traditions joyned with them for ſureties. Again, if any man ſhould go about to perſwade me, that there were any other go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment eſtabliſhed in the Church of God, then an Ariſtocrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call and a Presbyterian one, I ſhould notwithſtanding all humane reaſon to the contrary, ſubmit my ſelf to that kind of government,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158510:5"/>as being moſt confidently aſſured that it is warranted in Gods Word; which all Chriſtians are bound for ever to make the Rule and Square, both of our faith, manners and government. And here I muſt minde all thoſe that ſhall read this Book, that this is no new opinion of mine, but that which I have once and again ſuffered for: and if ever they have read my <hi>Elenchus religionis papiſticis,</hi> or my <hi>Flagellum pontificis,</hi> or my <hi>Apologie,</hi> or any of my Latine Books, in all thoſe they will finde, that the cauſe of all my ſufferings was this, and this only, That I maintained that all Churches were to be governed by an Ariſtocraticall and Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government, which in thoſe Books I have clearly and fully (through Gods aſſiſtance) made good. Yea, in my anſwer to the Bill of Information put up againſt me in the Star-chamber, they ſhall have ſome reaſons I gave there, of this my tenent, to the Lords of his Majeſties Privie Councell, and Judges in the Star-chamber; ſo that I ſtand to my principles and am no ſtarter. And if then a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt Gods people it was thought an opinion worthy the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for, and my Chriſtian brethren deemed me worthy of honour for it, and afforded me their prayers, and ſhewed me and mine in all our diſtreſſes, many curteſies, when we found little favour from our own brethren (which their humanity I muſt never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get, but with all due thankfulneſſe for ever acknowledge) I ſay, if then this my opinion was thought Orthodox, and worthy of their applauſe, I ſee no good reaſon why a truth then ſhould not be counted a truth now; for the Word of God out of which I had it is the ſame, and if it were good then, it is good now: for the change of mens minds cannot change the truth, but it muſt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truth: but this my opinion I learned out of Gods Word then, which ſhall be for ever, by his gracious aſſiſtance the warrant of my beliefe and practice. This Word therefore, I deſire all my Chriſtian Brethren, in the deciding of this queſtion now agitated, amongſt Gods people and his faithfull ſervants, concerning Church-government, to take into their hands, and with thoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereans</hi> to ſit down and examine whatſoever ſhall be ſaid on either ſide according to the holy Scriptures: and I intreat them alſo to lay aſide all paſſion (which Religion has no need of) and all vain-glory and bitterneſſe, which is a diſhonour to our holy calling, and in the ſpirit of meekneſſe, and with a Virgine judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not raviſht with any previous or anticipated opinion, to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:158510:5"/>come and approach to the Altar of truth, and ſo conſider and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, which of thoſe two opinions the Brethren on both ſides now ſacrifice themſelves unto, be the offering that will beſt endure the firy-tryall, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Presbyterian go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment Dependent, or a Presbyterian government Independent, both now laid upon the Altar, be the acceptableſt ſervice, and beſt pleaſing ſacrifice. This is granted on all ſides, and of neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty it muſt be yeilded unto, that that Oblation is the beſt and moſt acceptable that is offered up by faith, without which it is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible to pleaſe God, and that ſacrifice only is offered up by faith, which is according to his Word, and has its warrant from his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed will, which is the rule both for worſhip and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church we are to be guided by. The Brethren on both ſides agree about the rule in deciding of this Controverſie and make the written word the rule. They agree alſo about the materials, both acknowledgeing a Presbytery, the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them is only about the mould and manner of the offering. I will therefore ſtate the queſtions between us, and ſhew where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we differ, and then ſet down my own opinion with my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and after endeavour to be a Moderator for the determining of this unhappy difference, which hath been an occaſion of ſo much rejoycing to the common Enemy.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold queſtion between us, they call the Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, and our Brethren they tearme Independents. The firſt is concerning the government of the Church, <hi>viz.</hi> whether it be Presbyterian Dependent, or Presbyterian Independent. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is, concerning the gathering of Churches: but of that in its due place. The firſt queſtion is whether many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations or Chriſtian Aſſemblies (commonly called Churches in our dialect) in the which there are all the acts of worſhip, or all Ordinances, as the pure preaching of the Goſpell, the due and right adminiſtration of the Sacraments, the true invocation of God, Diſcipline rightly executed, and all other performances, which make for the eſſence and form of a true Church, and in the which aſſemblies likewiſe, they have all ſuch offices and helps of Government, as in their ſeverall places being rightly imployed, may ſerve for the edification of the ſame, and mutu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all comfort and benefit of each other, and the preſervation of all, as Presbytors, Elders, Deacons, and all other Officers; I ſay
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:158510:6"/>the queſtion between us and the brethren is, Whether all theſe ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, may be accounted but one Church, or make but one Church within their Precincts; and be to be under the government and rule of one Presbytery, or a Councell or Colledge of many Presbyters together, upon which, all the Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies under it are to depend; and to which in all weighty buſineſſes they are to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, for any injury or conceived wrong, or ſcandall; or for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſe of any abuſes in Doctrine or manners, and for the exerciſing of Church-Diſcipline upon incorrigable and ſcandalous offenders; as admonition for giving offence, ſuſpenſion from the Ordinances till amendment and reformornation; or if obſtinate, Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Or whether every one of thoſe particular Congregations, or Aſſemblies be they never ſo ſmall, ſeverally or conſidered a part, and by themſelves, be Independent; that is to ſay, have full and plenary authority within themſelves, without reference to this, or any other great Councell or Presbytery, for tranſacting or deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining all differences about faith or manners amongſt themſelves, or for the redreſſing of any grievances or abuſes, or the exerciſing of the power of Diſcipline or juriſdiction, and from the which there is no appeal for relief, though the parties offended conceive they have never ſo much injury or wrong done them? In a word, whether two Presbyters with a ſlender Congregation, have an abſolute kinde of Spirituall Soveraignty among themſelves, in their own Congregation, and as ample authority as was given to the whole Colledge of the Apoſtles, <hi>Mat.</hi> 17. and to the whole Presbytery in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> And this is the firſt Queſtion: Which that it may the better be underſtood, I will propound it in a ſimile, and that in a matter well known unto all men: The government of this famous City of <hi>London,</hi> and of many other great Cities through the Kingdome, are called Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations, that is to ſay, majeſtracies; and have in them a Secular or Civill Signory or Presbytry, who are inveſted with Authority to exerciſe all acts of Government amongſt themſelves, as if they were an abſolute Principality; and this Government, by which all Citizens and inhabitants within their Precincts and liberties, are to be ruled and ordered, as occaſion and neceſſity ſhall require, is committed to the Lord Mayors, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, who onely by ſuch other Officers as they
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:158510:6"/>ſhall allegate, are to manage and exerciſe this government ſo, that all particular Citizens, and all the Companies of ſeverall Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, are in their particular Wards, Precincts, and Fellowſhips, by their conſtitutions and Charter, to depend upon the determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of that Counſell, and are to make their addreſſes unto them upon any urgent occaſion, or conceived wrong, or when it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernes the common good, and for the time to ſtand unto their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrement. Now then, the queſtion between us and our Brethren is, as if there ſhould ariſe a controverſie in theſe ſeverall Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; Whether the Companies in each City where they all have their ſeverall Halls, and their ſeverall aſſemblies and meetings upon all occaſions, and have all their Officers, and exerciſe alſo a power of ruling and juriſdiction among themſelves be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that is to ſay, have plenary authority within themſelves without reference to the Lord Mayor or Aldermen or Common-counſell, to determine of all things among their ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and from the which there is no appeale for reliefe; though one be never ſo much injured and damnified by any unjuſt act; and whether theſe ſeverall Companies and ſeverall Aſſemblies be each of them a ſeverall Corporation or Magiſtracy, or all of them put together make but one Corporation, under one civill Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery conſiſting of the Lord Mayor, Aldermen, and Common-counſell? This I thought fit to propound, that every one may the better underſtand the queſtion. Now, as this kingdome of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land hath its ſeverall Corporations through all Counties, and the which Corporations, although they have their ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in them, yet are all dependent upon a civill Presbytery and Common-counſell, and every Company in them makes not a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Corporation or Magiſtracy, or a ſeverall City, but are all dependent upon the Common-counſell or Presbytery, for the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ordering and governing of them in all their common affaires, and for the redreſſing of abuſes, and taking away and removing of common grievances, and have their ſeverall appeals to the Common-counſell, the Lord Mayor, and Aldermen; and if they finde no juſtice there nor ſatisfaction, have their redreſſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to ſome generall Court, or ſome ſupreame judicature, as to the Parliament of the Kingdome, who redreſſe and determine all things according to the lawes and conſtitutions of the whole Kingdome. So in the Kingdome of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:158510:7"/>is his Church, all theſe ſeverall Churches which we reade of in the holy Scripture of the New Teſtament, are ſo many ſeverall Corporations and Aſſociations, all the ſeverall congregations and affemblies as ſo many ſeverall Companies in them, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a Presbyterie or Common-counſell and Colledge of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors and Rulers, all making up but one Church in every one of their juriſdictions and ſeverall Precincts, though they be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent of never ſo many ſeverall Aſſemblies, according to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Cities or Townes wherein they are, or according to the ſeverall Hundreds or Diviſions aſſigned to each Presbytery, and all theſe and ſeverall aſſociations to be governed by their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbyteries for the better ordering and preſerving of the ſame, to the which every particular man, as well as any Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly or Congregation, may have their appeal for the redreſſe of any abuſes or enormities, and if they finde themſelves wronged there, then they have appeals to ſome other higher Presbytrie or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell of Divines for relief and juſtice; and both they and all other of the ſeverall Corporations to be governed and regulated by the lawes and ſtatutes given by Chriſt himſelfe, the only Head and King of his Church, according only to whoſe lawes they are to be governed and ruled for the common good and preſervation of the whole Church, divided into thoſe ſeverall Juriſdictions, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations or Precincts, in imitation as neer now as may be of the Churches of <hi>Ieruſalem, Epheſus, Corinth,</hi> and <hi>Galatia, &amp;c.</hi> and whoſe lawes alone muſt be the rule for the ordering of all their governement, doctrine, and manners.</p>
            <p>I have premiſed this I have now ſaid, that all men may the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter underſtand the ſtate of the queſtion and controverſie in hand. Now then, if it ſhall be made appeare out of the holy Scripture, that all the ſeverall Churches we have mention of in the New Teſtament, were all particular corporations or aſſociations, and governed by a common-counſell of Presbyters, or by a Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall government in each of them; and that there were many aſſemblies and congregations in thoſe ſeverall Churches, and all of them had their diſtinct Officers amongſt themſelves, in the which likewiſe they had all the acts of worſhip amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and did partake in al ordinances of Church-fellowſhip, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the preaching of the Word, Prayer, &amp; in the Sacraments of Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, and yet made but one Church,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:158510:7"/>and were all governed by a common-counſell of Presbyters, or by a common Presbyterie within their Precincts, then it muſt of neceſſity follow, that as the Mother-churches were firſt govern'd, all the Daughter-churches to the end of the world muſt be ſo go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd, and according to that rule that is ſet down in the Word of God. So then, the queſtion in hand between us and our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren is, <hi>Whether there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies in any of thoſe primitive Churches, as in that of Ieruſalem the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Church, and many Elders or Presbyters in that Church, and all other Officers; and whether all thoſe Congregations and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies were one Church, and thoſe Presbyters and Officers all of them Elders and Officers of that one Church, and whether all thoſe Congregations and Aſſemblies were under one Presbytery?</hi> This I ſay is the queſtion between us and our Brethren. Now then if it can be proved, that there were more Beleevers in the Church of Jeruſalem then could all meet in one place, or in one congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for all acts of worſhip; and if it can be evidently elucidated, that there were ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations in the Church of Jeruſalem, and yet ſo, as they made but one church for government; then our Brethren muſt of neceſſity acknowledge that the church of Jeruſalem was govern'd by a common-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of Presbyters, or was presbyterially governed. Neither did our Brethren ever yet undertake to prove, that in caſe there were many Aſſemblies in Jeruſalem, they had ſeverall and independent presbyteries, neither if they ſhould go about to prove, could they do it. And therefore we may conclude, and that with very good reaſon and warrantable authority, that as the Mother-church, the Church of Jeruſalem in her greateſt glory was govern'd, ſo all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches muſt likewiſe be regulated to the end of the world; <hi>For out of Zion ſhall go forth the Law, and the Word of the Lord from Ieruſalem, Iſay</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 3. We muſt have both our Law from thence, and our paterne of government. And our Brethren doe make the Church of Jeruſalem the patern of their proceedings.</p>
            <p>Now that all things may be handled in good order and in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodicall way, I will reduce the whole Diſputation concerning the firſt Queſtion into theſe four Propoſitions, and prove them in order. The firſt, <hi>That there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="5 letters">
                     <desc>•••••</desc>
                  </gap> of Beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, in the which they enjoyed all acts of worſhip, and all the Ordinances amongst
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:158510:8"/>themſelves, and did partake of all acts of Church-followſhip, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally of preaching, and in the administration of the Satraments and Prayer,</hi> and that before the Perſecution we reade of, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. <hi>v.</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The ſecond, <hi>That all theſe Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies made but one Church.</hi> The third, <hi>That the Apoſtles and Elders governed, ordered, and ruled this Church, joyntly and by a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-counſell and Presbytery.</hi> The fourth, <hi>That this Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, and the government of the ſame, is to be a pattern for all ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies in any City or vicinity to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite into one Church; and for the Officers of thoſe congregations to governe that Church joyntly in a Colledge or Presbyterie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I come to the proof of theſe particulars, it will not be amiſſe in generall to take notice that all the Churches we read of in the New Teſtament, were Ariſtocratically and Presbyteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally governed, and were all dependent upon their ſeverall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteries; and that the ordering and managing of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay only upon the Presbyterie, and was their peculiar who had the power of the Keyes. Now Chriſt gave the Keyes to the Apoſtles and Presbyters only, and whatſoever the Apoſtles did in ordering and ſetling the government of the Church, they did by Chriſts command; and that order and conſtitution they ſet down in the Church, was to be perpetuated and continued to the end of the world. And the violating of this order and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſtitution, was the occaſion of the riſe and growth of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt, and the very cauſe of all thoſe confuſions that the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an world hath for theſe many generations been wearied and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noyed with; and the occaſion of all thoſe Schiſmes, Sects, and Hereſies the world hath ever ſwarmed with: and the re-eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing and reducing of it to its priſtine conſtitution, will be a means not only of removing all ſcandall, and taking away of all diviſion amongſt Brethren, and be a ſingular means alſo of eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing a flouriſhing governments in Church and State, and for the procuring of the bleſſings of God upon the three Kingdomes, but a way alſo of ruining that Man of Sinne, and of making an abſolute Reformation through the whole world.</p>
            <p>Let us therefore firſt take notice what government was eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed by God in all the Primitive Churches, <hi>Acts</hi> 1 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="13" facs="tcp:158510:8"/>them to the Lord, on whom they beleeved.</hi> Here are two things obſervable. The firſt, that the government of the Church was committed to the Presbyters. The ſecond, that the Presbyteriall government was that government that was eſtabliſhed in every Church; for ſo ſaith the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>when they had ordained them Presbyters in every Church.</hi> This was Gods ordinance, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.17. <hi>And from Miletus he ſent to Epheſus, and called the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church.</hi> Here we ſee there were many Presbyters in one Church. And <hi>Verſ.</hi> 28. <hi>Take heed therefore unto your ſelves,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>and to all the flock over which the Holy Ghoſt hath made you Biſhops, to feed the Church of God which he hath purchaſed with his own blood.</hi> Here, as we may obſerve, that in Gods Dialect, Presbyters and Biſhops were all one, ſo likewiſe is evident that the Church was committed to their government: this Church therefore of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was under a Presbytery, and was to be regulated joyntly by them by a common-counſell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> chap. 1. verſ. 5. <hi>For this cauſe,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>left I thee in Creet, that thou ſhouldeſt put in order the things that are wanting, and ordaine Presbyters in every City, as I appointed thee. If any man be blameleſſe, &amp;c. for a Biſhop muſt be blameleſſe as the Steward of God, &amp;c.</hi> From this place likewiſe we may take notice of the parity between Presbyter and Biſhop, and that the Presbyterian government was that way of ruling that God appointed, not in one City only, but in every City, and that theſe Presbyters were the Stewards in Gods houſe, which is his Church, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. and had the government of thoſe Churches in every City laid upon them, which they were joyntly to governe and order by the common-counſell of Presbyters. And <hi>Paul</hi> in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> ch. 5. v. 17. <hi>Let the Preſbyters,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that rule well, be counted worthy of double honour, especially they who labour in word and doctrine.</hi> Still we ever obſerve, that the rule and government of the Church was in the Presbyters hands. And the Author of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> ch. 13.7. <hi>Remember,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, who have spake unto you the Word of God, whoſe faith follow, conſidering the end of their converſation.</hi> And verſ. 17. <hi>Obey,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>them that have the rule over you, and ſubmit your ſelves, for they watch for your ſoules, as they that muſt give an account, &amp;c.</hi> And in verſ. 24. <hi>Salute all them,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that have the rule over you, and all the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:158510:9"/>Saints.</hi> Here againe he injoynes all the Churches to yeild obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and to ſubmit themſelves unto the government of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterie, ſhewing them that it is their place to obey, and for their Miniſters to rule; and that ſo long as they command in the Lord, they out of conſcience ought to obey them, and that for a double reaſon; <hi>For they watch,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>for your ſouls,</hi> and <hi>they muſt alſo give an account</hi> of their ſtewardſhip. And in 1 <hi>Peter</hi> 5, 1, 2, 3. <hi>The Preſbyters that are among you,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Peter, I exhort, who am alſo a Preſbyter, and a witneſſe of the ſufferings of Chriſt, and alſo a partaker of the glory that ſhall be revealed; feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the overſight thereof, not by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, but willingly, &amp;c. neither as being Lords over Gods he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage, but being examples to the flock.</hi> And Saint <hi>James</hi> chap. 5. ver. 14. <hi>Is any among you ſick?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>let him call for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of the Church.</hi> He doth not ſay of the Churches, but of the Church. So that the Presbyterian government was in every Church, and every Church was to ſubmit it ſelf unto the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. And in <hi>Acts</hi> 15. it is ſaid, that <hi>Paul and Barnabas went up to the Apoſtles and Presbyters, &amp;c. And when they came to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem they were received of the Church</hi> (it is not ſaid of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, but of the Church) and of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, &amp;c. and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 6. And the Apoſtles and Presbyters came together to conſider of the matter, &amp;c. and <hi>Verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>Then pleaſed it the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles and Preſbyters with the whole Church, &amp;c.</hi> and wrote Letters by them after this manner. <hi>The Apoſtles, and Preſbyters, and Brethren.</hi> And <hi>Acts</hi> 21.17. <hi>And when we were come to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>Luke, the Brethren received us gladly. And the day following Paul went in with us in to James, and all the Preſbyters were preſent.</hi> From all which places, and many more which might be produced, it is moſt clear and evident, that in all Cities there was a Presbytery, and that the Presbyters had the power of order, namely, of preaching, and the power of juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, that is of ruling, which was ever to be exerciſed with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not alone; and that conſiſted in admitting of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and in conventing men before them upon occaſion, in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſhing if any offended, in ſuſpending from the holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion till reformation or amendment; and if they continued obſtinate and incorrigible, in excommunicating and caſting of them out of the Church, and upon repentance, in receiving of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:158510:9"/>them in againe, and in ordaining of Officers, and in appointing the times of meeting, and the places where. And within theſe limits, as I conceive, is all the power given to the Presbyters ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, and this they are by Gods ordinance joyntly and by the common-counſell of Presbyters to exerciſe; and therefore the Presbyterian government was the order of ruling and governing all Churches, that God himſelf eſtabliſhed, and is to be continued to the end of the world; neither do I ever reade, that the people or the congregations were joyned with them in their commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or had any power given them of ruling. For Saint <hi>Paul</hi> profeſſeth of himſelf in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.37. that whatſoever he writ in his Epiſtles <hi>were the commands of the Lord.</hi> And the ſame may be ſaid of all the other Apoſtles. Now <hi>Paul</hi> writ to <hi>Titus,</hi> that the Churches in all Cities ſhould be governed by a Presbytery. And in his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy</hi> he commands <hi>Timothy</hi> againe and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine in chap. 5. verſ. 21. and in chap. 6. v. 12, 13. I give thee charge in the ſight of God, &amp;c. <hi>That thou keep this command without ſpot, unblameable till the appearing of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Here <hi>Timothy</hi> and all Miniſters in him, are to the end of the world bound to maintaine that government unblameable that was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Apoſtles; and that was the Presbyterian govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the ruling of all Churches by joynt conſent, and a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-counſell or Colledge of Presbyters; ſo that nothing ought to be done or tranſacted of publick concernment without their joynt and mutuall accord or agreement and common conſent of the Presbytery. And therfore when <hi>Diotrephes</hi> aſſumed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his particular congregation a power and authority to rule according to his will &amp; pleaſure, without the conſent of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery, &amp; oppoſed <hi>John</hi> the Presbyter, he ſharply reproves his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings &amp; ſignifies to the Church, <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 3. That when he came he would remember his words, and teach him how to prate againſt the Presbytery with malicious words; <hi>For he</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenteth not himſelf onely to prate maliciouſly againſt us, but he will not receive the brethren, nor ſuffer others, but casteth them out of the Church; which is an evill thing in him,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John: But for you,</hi> ſaith he, ſpeaking to the Church, <hi>follow not that which is evill but that which is good.</hi> It was evill in him to aſſume unto himſelfe alone, and his particular Congregation, that power that belonged unto the colledge or councell of Presbyters, and was
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:158510:10"/>to be moderated and exerciſed onely by the conjoynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent of the Presbytery. For God had appointed, that his Church ſhould be governed by a Presbytery; and <hi>Diotrephes</hi> would have his Congregation Independent, and have an abſolute juriſdiction within it ſelf, <hi>Which,</hi> ſaith Saint <hi>John, is an evill thing.</hi> So that I cannot but wonder, that our brethren the Independents ſhould call <hi>Diotrephes</hi> the Patriarch of the Presbyterians, as one of them did to me not long ſince; whereas if the place be due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed and conſidered; it will appear that he was the firſt that oppoſed the Presbyterian Government, and for the which he was by Saint <hi>John</hi> ſharply reproved, and in him, all that follow his ſteps, and will not ſubmit themſelves to the Presbytry which is Gods Ordinance, and that will not receive the brethren into the Churches, but upon their own termes and conditions. But of this buſineſſe when I come to the ſecond Queſtion: In the mean time, it is by the Word of God, ſufficiently confirmed, that all the Churches we read of in the New Teſtament were ſo many cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations in Chriſts Kingdome, which were to be governed by a common councell of Presbyters. And ſo for many years after the Apoſtles it was governed <hi>Communi conſilio Presbytererum,</hi> as our brethren the Independents do confeſſe and proove by anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and humane authority, which weapon I do wonder they will contend with, in deciding of Gods matters, which are onely out of his holy Word to be proved; which is to be the rule of our faith. But it ſeems Saint <hi>Ambroſe</hi> his Authority pleaſeth them well, though if we looke into it, it makes much againſt them. He lived, as the Author that cites him ſaith, within the fourth Centory, his words are theſe upon the firſt of <hi>Timothy, Synagoga &amp; postea Eccleſia ſeniores habuit, quorum ſine conſilio, nihil age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur in Eccleſia. Quod quâ negligentia obſoleverit neſcio, niſi do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum deſidia aut magis ſuperbia, dum ſoli volunt aliquid videri.</hi> Take with it his own interpretation. <hi>The Iewes Synagogue,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and afterwards the Chriſtian Church had Elders, without whoſe counſell nothing was done in the Church; which by what neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect it grew out of uſe, I know not, unleſſe it were perhaps the ſloath, or rather pride of the Teachers, whileſt alone they would ſeem to be ſome body.</hi> Here it is acknowledged by their own teſtimony, that in the Apoſtles time and many years after the Apoſtles, nothing was done in the Church without the counſell of the Presbyters;
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:158510:10"/>ſo that it is evident the Primitive Churches were governed by the joynt and common councell of the Presbytery, and the people had nothing to do with it. We may adde here unto Saint <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe,</hi> Saint <hi>Jeromes</hi> teſtimony, who in his Commentaries upon the firſt chapter of the Epiſtle of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus,</hi> largely decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring himſelf (as in many other places) concerning the occaſion of the change of that government eſtabliſhed by the Apoſtles, ſaith, <hi>Idem est ergo Preſbyter qui &amp; Epiſcopus, &amp; antequàm, dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boli instinctu, ſtudia in religione fierent, &amp; diceretur in populis, ego ſum Pauli, ego Apollo, ego autem Cephae, communi Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rorum conſilio Eccleſiae gubernabantur, &amp;c.</hi> In the which words he acknowledgeth by the firſt inſtitution, all Churches were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the common councell of the Presbyters, and not by the advice of the people. Yea the very Canons of the Pope in the firſt part, and the 95. diſtinction, giving the reaſon why the Presbyterian Government came to be changed, and the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiall was put in the place; affirmeth, that it was through fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and for the avoyding of further Schiſmes and rents in the Church and cities, the very words before coted out of Saint <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome,</hi> and confeſſe that before that time, the Churches were go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned <hi>Communi conſilio Preſbyterorum,</hi> not by the people or any one Prelate, but by the Presbytery and their councell. And if hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane authority were needfull in this buſineſſe, I might make a volume with their very expreſſions, to prove the novelty of the Hirarchicall government, and that of the peoples juriſdiction aſſuming the Authority of governing into their hands, and the Antiquity of the Presbytery and that by the enemies own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. But I am reſolved to cleave onely unto the Word, and ſound reaſon deduced from thence, for the deciding of this controverſie, being ſorry that there was ſo much as occaſion of naming humane authority in a point of Divinity. As for the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian government, in the ſenſe that I underſtand it, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more cleer to me in all the holy Scripture. Yea the very word and name of Presbytery ſignifieth a magiſtracy, or Ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy, or Signory, or Court; that is, a Company, or Senate, or Councell of grave, wiſe, and underſtanding men, inveſted with authority and power of ruling, ordering, and commanding, and in whoſe hands the government is put. And as the word is taken in the civill polity and Government, ſo in the Eccleſiaſticall;
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:158510:11"/>by a Presbytery we underſtand, a Religious, Grave, Solid, Lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and wiſe councell of Divines and Miniſters, or men of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate experience; and ſuch as know how to Rule and Govern thoſe that are under their command, with wiſedome and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and according to the Word of God; and the which men likewiſe are inveſted with Authority and Power, for to exerciſe a juriſdiction over others, and are hereunto called by ſuch as are able to judge and diſcern of the ſufficiency of their gifts and abilities for this work, which the ordinary and common people cannot do. And as in the civill State, the Presbyters and Elders of the people, were thoſe that had the rule over them, for the common good of them all and for their bodily preſervation: So the Presbyters and Elders of the Church are thoſe that have the rule and government over the Churches for the ſpirituall good of their ſouls. And as Kings and Rulers are by a Metaphoricall and borrowed ſpeech called Paſtors and Sheepheards of the people, and are ſaid to feed the flocks committed to their charge, by which word is underſtood the exerciſe of all lawfull and mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate authority agreeable to the Law of God over them; ſo the Presbyters and Miniſters are called the Paſtors and Sheepheards, yea, and Stewards over the flocks committed to their charges, and they are commanded to feed them, by which metaphor they are inveſted with the authority and power both of preaching and ruling, and have the Government over thoſe flocks put into their hands, which they muſt alwayes exerciſe according to Gods Word; they muſt feed them and rule them in the Lord, and not after their own wills and pleaſures, they may not <hi>have dominion over our faith,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 2. of the <hi>Corinthians, chap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 24. <hi>But that they ſhould be helpers of our joy;</hi> that is, they may not uſurpe an abſolute Soveraignty or power over the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the people, as if the ſpirituall ſtate and welfare of their flocks depended on them, which is onely grounded upon their faith in Jeſus Chriſt; but as they are the Stewards of God, and Miniſters and ſervants of the Church, ſo they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them and rejoyce their hearts in the Lord, and eſtabliſh them in the faith; and uſe all the care and diligence that is poſſible, like good Sheepheards, to preſerve the flocks committed to their charge, that they ſtraggle and ſtray not from Chriſts fould, and run not into the by-wayes and thickets of ſin and errour, and be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:158510:11"/>corrupted with noyſome food, and falſe Doctrine: and if they have any among them that are unruly, that they bring and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them into order: or if they have any ſick, feeble, poor or weak, that they cure, releeve, comfort, and reſtore ſuch: and if they have any that are infected or ſcabby, that they remove ſuch from the ſound, till they be recovered: or if they have any broken or wounded, that they heal and recover them with all lenity and humanity; and that they ſhould by common councell govern and order their flocks, and take ſpeciall care that the particular Paſtors and Miniſters of the ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their Presbytery and charge, aſſume not any ſole and ſoveraign Authority to themſelves over the flock, to do any thing of publike concernment, without the joynt conſent of that Presbytery or ſpirituall corporation, under whoſe commands they are. And it ſtands with all reaſon, that a Common Councell, of godly, grave, learned, and experienced miniſters, ſhould ever be more able to manage and order a government, then two or three unexperienced men, or two or three hundred young people, of which moſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations conſiſt, in whom the ſap of youth is not yet dryed up; or if many of them ſhould be of riper years, yet they know little what belongs to government, and therefore they can never be ſo well able to govern, as men both of known learning, ancient experience, and honeſty, and approved judgement and integrity, as a whole Colledge or an Aſſembly of learned Presbyters common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly are; who by God himſelf have the diſpenſation of the Word and the ordering and ruling of the Church committed unto them, and who in the preaching of the Word, and the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and in all ordinary acts of worſhip, and in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ruling the flocks committed to their ſeverall charges; are the ſucceſſors of the holy Apoſtles. But by the way, an objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is here to be anſwered unto, made by ſome of the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents after this manner. The Elders and Presbyters of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, ſay they, by the impoſition of their hands, gave the gifts of tongues and propheſie, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.1, 2, 3, 4, 5. and the 8.18. and 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. and healed the ſick <hi>Iames</hi> 5.14, 15. according to our Saviours promiſe <hi>Mark</hi> 16.18. Let, ſay they, the Presbyters of our time, let them impoſe their hands upon the ſick and heale them, let them by impoſing hands upon their diſciples inable them on a ſudden to ſpeake with ſtrange tongues, and foretell
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:158510:12"/>things to come; and then we will acknowledge them for a true Presbytery, then will they be a right aſſembly of Elders, and the Apoſtles ſucceſſors: but, if they cannot give to others, nor yet have for themſelves in ſtore, any of the true Apoſtles, any of the right Presbyters gifts and characters, we may not, we dare not acknowledge them as ſuch. Theſe are their formall words in print. Before I come to my anſwer, I deſire there may be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all notice taken of this Objection, and ſuch like; for, for ought that I know, if any man will argue after this manner, all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an religion may be called in queſtion, and no man will have any Creed or Belief, except he may make his own Articles, as <hi>Thomas</hi> did, who ſaid, <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nleſſe I put my hands into his ſide, and my fingers into the print of the nailes, I will not believe.</hi> And as the Jewes ſaid unto our bleſſed Saviour, <hi>Thou that ſavest others, now ſave thy ſelfe, come down from the Croſſe and then we will believe in thee,</hi> do this miracle and then thou wilt perſwade us. Here we ſee, they would make their own Articles, or elſe they would have no Creed. The Jewes had learned this method of diſputing from the Devill, who at his meeting of our Saviour Chriſt, and at his firſt aſſault, thus diſputed, If thou be the Sonne of God, ſaith he, and wouldeſt have the world ſo believe, and me too, on thee, then command theſe ſtones to be made bread, do this miracle firſt; but thou canſt not do it, <hi>Ergo.</hi> So in like manner theſe men argue, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, ſay they, the Presbyters by the impoſition of their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their Diſciples, can inable them on a ſudden to ſpeak with ſtrange tongues, to foretell things to come, and heal the ſick, &amp;c. we will not acknowledge them to be true Elders: but let them do all theſe things by the impoſition of their hands, and then we will acknowledge them for a true Presbyterie. See the vanity of theſe men, and the inſtability of their faith, by their own confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; miracles will make them believe any thing, if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite their own words, though never ſo contrary to their judgment and to the faith once delivered to the Saints. It is well known to the Learned, that the Apoſtles and thoſe Primitive chriſtians had extraordinary and wonderfull gifts, that raviſht the world then into admiration; and it is confeſt alſo by all underſtanding Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that thoſe wonder-working miracles were but temporary, as the miraculous feeding of the people with <hi>Manna</hi> in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe, where they were fellow-communers with the Angels,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:158510:12"/>and continued but till they came into the Land that flowed with Milk and Honey. So thoſe miracles of the Primitive chriſtians continued but for a time, till the Goſpell and the truth of the Chriſtian faith and doctrine was confirmed and eſtabliſhed, which being once done, and the holy Scriptures which were to be the rule of faith to the end of the world being left to poſterity, and to which we are tyed and commanded not to be wiſe above that which is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. and forbid in <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8, 9. to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe then we have been taught, though the Apoſtles or an Angell from Heaven ſhould teach otherwiſe, after, I ſay, the Doctrine of the Chriſtian Faith and Religion was confirmed, the ordinary working of Miracles ceaſed. And it is ſaid of Antichriſt in 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> chap. 2. <hi>That he ſhall come with ſtrong deluſions and ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wonders, and with all deceiveablenes in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> So that I cannot ſufficiently wonder, to ſee the dealing of theſe men, who in theſe dayes expect and look for miracles to confirme their faith, when notwithſtanding we are forwarned to take heed of all falſe deluſions, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded to the contrary. Shew us ſome miracles, ſay they, and then we will believe you are true Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. So dealt the Jewes with Chriſt, What ſigne ſheweſt thou that we may believe in thee? But when Chriſt had ſhewed them ſigne upon ſigne, and miracle upon miracle, were they ever the more convinced? Did thoſe miracles create belief in them? No ſurely, but rather hardned them and made them blaſpheme. When he caſt out Devils, they ſay, he did it by the Prince of Devils. So without doubt, if the Presbyters had thoſe gifts of miracles, that they could gratifie theſe men with daily prodigies and works of wonder, they would then ſay, they came with lying wonders, and with the working of Satan, and they would make the world abhor them the more. There is an old ſaying, That he muſt riſe early and never go to bed, that will pleaſe all men: and truly it would be not only difficult, but an impoſſible thing, for any State or great Councell, were it never ſo wiſe, to pleaſe all the people under them. God himſelf, nor <hi>Moſes,</hi> nor <hi>Aaron</hi> his ſervants, could pleaſe the Iſraelites though they ſaw never ſuch wonders continually before their eyes, to confirme their authority; yea they told <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to their faces, that they took too much upon them. And afterwards they caſt off Gods own government
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:158510:13"/>and God himſelf, as the Lord complains to <hi>Samuel</hi> in 1 <hi>Samuel,</hi> and would ſet up a government after the modell of their owne brain, as it is at large ſet down in that Book. And not long after they changed the manner of Gods worſhip, in <hi>Jeroboams</hi> time, <hi>and taught the fear of God,</hi> as the Lord complaineth, <hi>Iſay</hi> 29. <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the precepts of men,</hi> and rejected Gods Commandements, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. and <hi>Mark</hi> 7. So that what they thought beſt in their own eyes, that was ever beſt pleaſing unto them. They would not content themſelves with the written Word, though they were never ſo often by <hi>Moſes,</hi> and all the reſt of the Prophets, commanded to cleave unto it; ſaying to the Law and to the Teſtimony, <hi>Iſay</hi> 8. Even ſo it is now in theſe dayes, they content not themſelves with that ordinance that is ſet down in the written Word, but ſay; Come ſhew us ſome miracles, and then we will believe you are a right Presbyterie. Our Saviour ſpeaking to the Jewes concerning S. <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>Iohn,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>came neither eating nor drinking, and ye ſay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold he hath a Devil; the Sonne of Man came both eating and drinking, and ye ſay, he is a wine-bibber, a friend of Publicans and Sinners.</hi> So that whatſoever method or way God uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them, they cavil'd againſt it, and were never ſatisfied; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes reſiſting the Spirit of God, as <hi>Stephen</hi> told them in <hi>Acts</hi> 7. So now, in theſe our times they look for miracles, and a new way of teaching. But all good Chriſtians are forbid to liſten after, or to give heed to miracles; and are ſent unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets <hi>Luke</hi> 16. and are commanded to ſearch the Scripture <hi>Iohn</hi> 5. Yea our Saviour himſelf in the perſon of <hi>Abraham, Luke</hi> 16. ſaith, That if men wil not believe <hi>Moſes</hi> &amp; the Prophets, they wil not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by miracles: and I am confident, that could the Presbyters do al thoſe miracles theſe men deſire, they wold the more reprocah them, and exclaime againſt them, &amp; affirme they wrought by the Devill, as the Jewes told our Saviour he did. I muſt confeſſe, I am of a contrary opinion to theſe men, not only in the matter of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, but in all externall performances; for I am inſtructed in the holy Scriptures, that the Devill can transforme himſelf into an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gell of light, and that the Deceivers and falſe Teachers ſhall come forth in ſheeps clothing, and for outward appearance ſhall equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lize, if not exceed, the faithfulleſt and trueſt Paſtors and Miniſters of Chriſt; and therefore we are in ſpeciall, commanded to take
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:158510:13"/>heed of ſuch: and for my particular, if any men whatſoever, of never ſuch ſeeming ſanctity, ſufficient abilities, unblameable life, ſhould come forth and teach any other Doctrine of Faith, Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, or Government, then that I have been taught in the holy Scripture; and ſhould confirme this their doctrine with never ſo many miracles, I will ſtill continue ſtedfaſt in the Doctrine of the Apoſtles, and cleave unto the written Word, and will never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve contrary to that, though I ſhould undergoe the greateſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, or be expoſed to the greateſt want by it, that any man ever ſaw: for I know that all theſe momentary trials and afflictions, are not worthy that exceeding weight of glory that ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed. And for this very point of the Presbytery, in that ſenſe I take it, I am ſo well aſſured that it is Gods Ordinance, as I am of any point of Religion. But as I ſaid before, if men may argue af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>this way, <hi>The Preſbyters in the Apostles times did miracles, and ſpake with ſtrange tongues, and their Scholers and Diſciples did the ſame; do you likewiſe, and then we will acknowledge you to be true Preſbytters, otherwiſe we will not.</hi> Thus the Jewes might have ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued againſt all their Prophets, as againſt <hi>Iſaiah, Ieremy, Ezekiel, &amp;c. Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> faſted forty dayes and forty nights, and did many miracles, do you ſo, and then we will believe you are true Prophets, and ſent to us of God, otherwiſe we will not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you to be true Prophets. Yea all the wicked and ungodly men of theſe times may argue thus alſo. God gave unto his Church Apoſtles, Evangeliſts, Prophets, &amp;c. and they ſpake all ſtrange tongues and divers languages, and did many miracles; but you and your Congregations, have neither Apoſtles Prophets, nor E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts, nor ye have not the gifts of Tongues, nor ye can do no Miracle: <hi>Ergò,</hi> you are not the true Church. The Primitive Chriſtians and the ſervants of God in thoſe times, had the gifts of Tongues and Propheſie, and the Holy Ghoſt came down upon them, and they ſpake by direction from God his infallible truth and Goſpell, whoſe ſpeeches were not tied to time, and to one ſpeaker, but many ſpake one after another by interpreters, as it is at large ſet down in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 27, 28, 29, 30. &amp;c. So that they ſpake infallible truth by direction from God: but you have none in your congregations ſo miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly inſpired with ſundry languages and divers tongues, nor ye do not ſpeak infallible truths by direction from God; nor you
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:158510:14"/>cannot cure diſeaſes nor do miracles: <hi>Ergò,</hi> your religion is not the ſame Religion; nor your congregations the true Church: ſhew us theſe miracles and then we will beleeve you to be the true Church, otherwiſe we may not, we dare not acknowledge you to be the true Church. Again, they may argue thus: The Apoſtles and Primitive Paſtors, and Teachers preached freely, and labou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with their own hands, and were helpfull to the neceſſities of others, and were not burthenſome and exacting from others, and ſpake <hi>ex tempore,</hi> by direction from God: but your Miniſters in your Congregations do not preach freely, nor labour not with their own hands, nor are not helpfull to others neceſſities, but are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther burdenſome and exacting from others; nor they do no mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, nor ſpeak not immediately by inſpiration, and <hi>ex tempore;</hi> but by Study and out of their Books, and are confined to time, and ſpeak not in ſtrange tongues and languages, one after another by Interpreters. <hi>Ergò</hi> your miniſters are not Gods Miniſters, nor your Congregations the true Church, nor your people true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians; for you want all thoſe things that the Primitive Chriſtians and the Primitive Churches had.</p>
            <p>There is a Pamphlet lately come out, and highly eſteemed and priſed amongſt many, full of ſuch conſequences as theſe, which if they hold good againſt the Presbyters, they may alſo for ought I know, be of equall validity to overthrow, not onely all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Congregations, but indeed all Chriſtian Religion. But brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to anſwer. We look upon the Apoſtles and Primitive Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, as men miraculouſly and extraordinarily gifted, and as wonder-working men for the confirmation of the truth of the Goſpell to all ſucceeding ages; and we conſider in them and in the Chriſtians of thoſe times, ſomething extraordinary and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary, as their working of miracles, and ſpeaking of ſtrange tongues, and gifts of healing, &amp;c. And thoſe we conceive were to continue no longer in the Church, then for the confirmation of the truth of the Goſpel; Chriſt himſelf proclaiming thoſe bleſſed, that believe without ſeeing of miracles, ſpeaking unto <hi>Thomas, Iohn</hi> 20.29. <hi>Becauſe thou haſt ſeen me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thou believeſt, bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and have believed.</hi> So that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles now are not ordinary, and we are tied to the written Word. But we conſider likewiſe in the Apoſtles and Primitive Presbyters, that that was permanent and to continue in all Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:158510:14"/>and Presbyters, in all ſucceeding ages to the end of the world, and that was the power of order and preaching, and the power of juriſdiction that is of ruling (which is not denied by the moſt learned of the Independents themſelves) and this I have proved by the Word of God, to be tranſacted over to all Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whoſe Presbyters have that power given unto them; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will the Learned Brethren deny it, what ſo ever the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant may do. Yea, the very name of a Presbytery (as I ſaid before) if we look through the whole Scripture, ſignifieth a Magiſtracy, or Signiory, or Corporation inveſted with authority of governing and ruling; and ſuch a counſell and company of men, as upon whom the government under Chriſt is laid, and to be extended ſo far, as their juriſdiction extendeth, and as far as by common conſent it may make for the good and edification of the Church, and for the ſafety of the ſame. And ſuch was the government of all thoſe Churches of the New Teſtament, which were as ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Committees, their limits and bounds prefixed them, as at this day all Committees through the Kingdome have in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Hundreds, Wapentakes, and Cities, to whom the ordering and government of thoſe places that are under them, are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; ſo that all that is done or tranſacted, muſt be done by the joynt conſent and counſell of the whole Committee, not any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular man or any two of them ſeverally conſidered by themſelvs, can make an order, but that order only is binding which is made by the joynt conſent and common agreement of them all, or the greateſt part of them aſſembled together. Even ſo all thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregations that are within the compaſſe and juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſeverall Presbyteries, are to be ordered and governed by the common and joynt counſell of the ſeverall Presbyters, or the greater part of them. For this was the order the Apoſtles eſtabli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, appointing in every City a Presbyterie; and when they had ſo ordered the Churches, they ſet them all to their ſeverall im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, the Presbyters to command, and all the people and particular aſſemblies and congregations under them, to obey; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it ever found in the holy Scriptures, that the people were joyned with the Presbyters in their commiſſion. So that they that oppoſe this government, reſiſt Gods Ordinance. And if we looke into all the Epiſtles writ by the Apoſtles to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Churches, we ſhall finde in them, that they enjoyne all the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:158510:15"/>ſeverall congregations to yeild obedience to their Paſtors and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers over them, and ſignifie unto them that they owe unto them double honour, eſpecially ſuch as labour in Word and Doctrine; that is, they muſt yeild unto them, not only due reverence and ſubjection, and obedience to their counſell and juſt commands in the Lord. But that they ſhould alſo afford them the honour of maintenance, and take order there be a ſufficient and competent, yea, an honourable allowance for their ſupport; and that as they miniſter to them ſpirituall food for their ſoules, they ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe miniſter unto them all things neceſſary for the maintenance of them and their Families, that they may comfortably and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſolicitous care, follow their holy imployments and wait upon their ſeverall Miniſteries. So that the place and imployment of the Presbyters, is to teach and rule the people; and this is their proper work, and peculiarly belongs unto them; and the imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and place of the ſeverall congregations under them, is to hear and obey: and therefore if the ſeverall congregations do aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume unto themſelves the power of ruling, they take more upon them then by God is allowed them: and the Presbyters in yeilding unto it, reject their own right, and deveſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that authority that God hath put into their hands; and by ſo doing, in time may not only bring confuſion into the Church, but to all thoſe Countries where ſuch uſurpations are tolerated. I cannot but ſpeak my conſcience in this point: And truly, very reaſon dictates unto a man, that they only ſhould have the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of commanding and ruling over the Churches, to whom the power of the Keys is given. Now it is given only to the Miniſters and Presbyters, as we ſee it in <hi>Iohn</hi> 20.21. and <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17, 18. Where our Saviour Chriſt eſtabliſhed a ſtanding govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be continued to the end of the world, the violating and the overthrowing of the which, was the cauſe of all thoſe confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, both in doctrine and manners that is now come upon the world, and was the cauſe, not only of the riſe, but the growth of Antichriſt. And the reducing of it again into the Church, &amp; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſhing of it, will be the confuſion of that Man of Sin, and of all the Antichriſtian-brood, and be a means of eſtabliſhing truth and peace through the Chriſtian world. But it will not be amiſſe a little to conſider that place in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. <hi>If thy Brother,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall treſpaſſe against thee, go and tell him of it between thee
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:158510:15"/>and him alone: if he ſhall heare thee, thou ſhalt gaine thy brother; but if he will not heare thee, then take with thee one or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witneſſes, every word may be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed. And if he ſhall neglect to heare them; then tell it unto the Church: but if he neglect to heare the Church, let him be to thee as a Heathen man and a Publican. Verily, verily I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth, ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> In theſe words our Saviour Chriſt has reſpect unto the order and cuſtome of judicature in thoſe times in cenſuring mens manners and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, which among the Jewes was ordered and adminiſtred by an aſſembly and counſell of learned, experienced, and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous men, and by a Presbytery, Conſiſtory, or Colledge of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble men for governement, choſe and ſelected out of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for this very purpoſe, by ſuch as could judge and diſcerne of their abilities: the which aſſembly and company, is by Chriſt himſelf called a Church, becauſe it did repreſent the Church, and in this place Chriſt did eſtabliſh the like to be continued in the Chriſtian Church to the end of the world, making his Apoſtles this repreſentative body, and their ſucceſſors all the godly and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miniſters and Presbyters, and gives unto them the ſame power and Authority, to judge and determine of all things belonging unto faith &amp; manners that was obſerved in the Jewiſh Church, in all Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline. For otherwiſe, the Chriſtian Church ſhould be inferior to that of the Jews, if they had not the ſame Priviledges for the cenſuring of manners and Doctrines, and the ſame power of juriſdiction and ruling that they had. Now all power of juriſdiction among the Jews, was exerciſed not by the promiſcuous multitude, or by the whole Congregation, nor by any particular man, nor by two or three (as the place above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifies) but by an Aſſembly, Senate, Councell, or Presbytery of underſtanding men aſſigned to that purpoſe, which our Saviour himſelf calleth a Church; and this government eſtabliſhed in the Chriſtian Church, are the ſeverall Presbyteries, where all things are tranſacted by common and joynt conſent, and this was the practiſe of the Apoſtles at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who did all buſineſſe of publike concernment, by common and joynt conſent, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, in the firſt chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> in chuſing of an Apoſtle in <hi>Judas</hi> his place. And in the ſixt chapter in chuſing of Deacons,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:158510:16"/>and in the 15. chapter in determining the queſtion there in hand, all in a Presbyterian way and by common conſent. And this is that government, that God hath commanded to be perpetuateds to the end of the world, in theſe words; <hi>Whatſoever ye ſhall binde on earth, ſhall be bound in heaven, and whatſoever ye ſhall looſe on earth ſhall be looſed in heaven.</hi> So that the Presbyters onely have the power of the keyes, and it is their place onely to ordain Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and Church Officers, (whatſoever Authority the people may exerciſe in the chuſing of them) as <hi>Paul</hi> writes unto <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> and they onely are to judge and determine and to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in matters of manners and doctrine, and the people are to allow and approve it according to the Word of God. Yea the very Synagogues of the Jews, which were the ſame that our Churches are, were governed by a Presbytery, (as our brethren acknowledge) called by the name of the Rulers of the Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue, who governed by joynt and common councell; as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and manifeſt, in that there were ſuperior and inferior Judges, Commanders, and Rulers, according as their yeares, gravity, and wiſdome made them more eminent then others, and venerable to the people: as may appear in many places as <hi>Acts</hi> 18. <hi>ver.</hi> 8. It is ſaid there, <hi>That Chrispus the chiefe Ruler of the Synagogue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved with all his houſhould.</hi> So that if there were a chief Ruler, or Judge, or a Preſident; there muſt of neceſſity be a Councell or Segniory of inferiour ones, that had Rule and Authority over others as well as he: as where there is a chief Juſtice or Judge, there are other Judges joyned with him, as all reaſon perſwades, and there muſt needs be a Court of Judicature, where all things are tranſacted, by conjoynt and common conſent and agreement: and ſo it was in the Synagogues of the Jewes, who were ſubject to, and ordered by the determinations and arbitrement of their Rulers and Governours. So that the ſeverall Churches or Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues under the Jews, were in ſubjection to thoſe Rulers, and were governed according as by common councell they ordered. And <hi>Mat.</hi> the 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 22. <hi>And behold there came one of the Rulers of the Synagogue, whoſe name was Jairus,</hi> here was a ſpeciall <hi>Ecce</hi> added to take notice, that a great man, and one in authority, came unto Chriſt, and that in a publick way, and one of the Rulers of the Syn gogue. So that we may obſerve the people in every Synago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue were governed and commanded by their Rulers, and they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:158510:16"/>were to yeeld obedience unto them, and were not joyned with them in Commiſſion, but ſtood to their determination, as all men uſe to do in Courts of Judicature, that appeal unto them for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice. And this cuſtome and manner of government was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted over to the Chriſtian Churches, and thoſe that were called Rulers among them, are among Chriſtians ſometimes called Presbyters, ſometimes Guides, ſometimes Rulers, and by Chriſt himſelf and by his Apoſtles, are appointed over all Chriſtian Churches as ſo many corporations; to which all the Aſſemblies and Congregations under them, and committed to their charge, are to yeeld obedience and ſubmiſſion, in whatſoever they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand in the Lord, and according to his bleſſed Word; for that muſt be the rule both of their commanding and of the peoples obeying. And this Presbyterian government, is that manner and way of ruling all Aſſemblies and particular Congregations under it, that God hath appointed in his Church, to be continued to the end of the world; the which whoſoever reſiſteth, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God. And this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, in way of proof, That all Churches we have mention of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the New Teſtament, were Ariſtocratically and Presbyterially governed, that is, were under the Government of a colledge or Aſſembly of Presbyters.</p>
            <p>And now I come to prove in order the four Propoſitions or concluſions, I undertook to make good. The firſt was, That there were many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in the which they had all acts of worſhip, and did partake of all Ordinances and of Church-fellowſhip; and that before the perſecution we read of <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and under the perſecution, and after the perſecution. And for the proof of this Propoſition, and every branch of it, I will firſt produce ſuch places of Scripture as make for the manifeſtation of the truth, and from thence frame and form my Arguments. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 5, 6. <hi>In thoſe dayes came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderneſſe of Judaea, and ſaying, Repent ye, for the Kingdome of heaven is at hand. Then went out to him Jeruſalem, and all Judaea and all the Region round about Jordan, and were baptized of him in Jordan confeſſing their ſins.</hi> The Baptiſme of <hi>Iohn,</hi> as all the learned know, was the ſame with that of the Apoſtles, for he preached the Baptiſme of Repentance for the Remiſſion of ſins,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:158510:17"/>and Baptized all that came to him, into <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaying unto the People, <hi>That they ſhould beleeve on him which ſhould come after him, that is, on Chriſt Ieſus, Act.</hi> 19. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. He had his Commiſſion alſo from God as well as the Apoſtles, and Bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Chriſt himſelf; he preached alſo the Goſpell and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> as well as the Apoſtles; and had many ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Teſtimonies from Chriſt himſelf; as, <hi>That he was the greatest Prophet that ever was born of woman,</hi> and <hi>That he was a bright ſhining light,</hi> and <hi>That he was his witneſſe;</hi> and many other Encomiums and praiſes did Chriſt give of him, to ratifie his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and to ſhew that he was ſent of God, and that he was that <hi>Elias</hi> that was to come before the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> And all the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple owned, and took him for a man ſent of God, and <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> went out to him, and all the Region round about, and were Baptized of him. In theſe words we finde that the people of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were all turned Chriſtians, and made members of the Chriſtian Church, and were beleevers. For which way ſoever the word <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> be taken, it ſignifieth a numberleſſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of men, or an innumerable company. For, if we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at this time, ſhe was a moſt populous City: the Hiſtorians that write of that age, relate that ſhe had ſometimes in her, no leſſe then eleven or twelve hundred thouſand; but let it be taken that there were but ſix hundred thouſand inhabitants, it is a vaſt multitude, and yet ſeldome was there leſſe inhabitants in Jeruſalem, if any beliefe may be had to Hiſtorians; for at that time it was one of the Metropolis Cities of the world, and the glory of Nations, and the joy of the whole Earth; and beſides. there was then great expectation, as we may reade, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.11. <hi>That the Kingdome of God ſhould immediately appear,</hi> and all the Jewes out of all Nations where they were ſcattered, now repai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Jeruſalem, and returned into their own countrey, expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Meſſiah.</hi> So that at this time, we cannot conceive but that there were infinites of people in Jeruſalem, and it is ſaid, That Jeruſalem went <hi>out and was baptiſed by Iohn.</hi> By Jeruſalem, here metonimycally the place is taken for the people. Now when it is ſaid that a City goeth out, it is to be underſtood either of the whole people, Man, Woman, and Childe, old and young, with all the inhabitants; as many times it happens, in great Earth quakes, or ſome Peſtilence or Inundation, that all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:158510:17"/>are forced to leave a City, and to ſeek ſome other habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but we cannot conceive the going out of Jeruſalem to <hi>Iohn Baptist</hi> in this large ſenſe and expreſſion; ſo that in this place it muſt be taken Synecdochically, and we are to underſtand a great part, or a chief part for the whole: as when a City is ſaid to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertaine a King, or to go out to meet a King, here it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood principally of the chief Officers, as the Lord Mayor, Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and the Common-counſell, and all their ſeverall Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, and chiefe Captaines and Commanders, with all their mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence; ſo that in this notion the common people and the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Citizens are not thought on, or at leaſt are not numbred. As when JESUS was born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> and the Wiſe Men came to Jeruſalem, to enquire where they ſhould finde him that was born King of the Jewes, that they might worſhip him, for they had ſeen his Star, it is ſaid, That when <hi>Herod</hi> heard theſe things, <hi>He and all Ieruſalem was troubled with him.</hi> Here, by all Jeruſalem, is to be underſtood, all the chief Officers and Courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for the common people were glad of it; for that was the day they had long looked for, and rejoyced at: but <hi>Herod</hi> being an Uſurper and a Tyrant, and all his Nobles, Peers, and Great men being confederate with him, and adjutors in his uſurpation and tyranny, and conceiving that Chriſt was an earthly Monarch; and that after the manner of the Kings of the Earth, he would not only pull down the Uſurper, but likewiſe call all them in queſtion, as guilty of High Treaſon, and cut them off as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicers and abettors; this made them tremble and fear; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the generall fear of all the great men in Ieruſalem, and of all the Courtiers and Officers under <hi>Herod,</hi> therefore it is ſaid, that <hi>Herod</hi> and all Ieruſalem with him was troubled. So that Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants and their complyces never have any reall peace. But in this ſenſe alſo it cannot be underſtood, that <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> went out to <hi>Iohn</hi> and was baptized; it muſt therefore by a Synecdoche be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for all the common people promiſcuouſly, or for a mighty multitude of all ſorts, and of all ranks of people, and of all profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as Publicans, Souldiers, and the ordinary Inhabitants: and in this ſenſe the word Jeruſalem muſt be taken, for a mighty mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men in Jeruſalem that were made Chriſtians; for other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe the Evangeliſt would have ſaid, many went out of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem alſo, as well as out of other places: but in ſaying that all Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:158510:18"/>and all the Regions round about, and Jeruſalem went out; this metaphoricall expreſſion doth ſignifie, That an infinite num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people in Jeruſalem it ſelf, were made Chriſtians and members of the Church, and that it is ſo to be underſtood the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces following will evidently evince it: for in <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.12. our Saviour ſaith, <hi>That from the dayes of Iohn the Baptist, untill now, the Kingdome of Heaven ſuffereth violence, and the violent take it by force,</hi> then the which, there could nothing be ſpoke more em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically, to ſet forth the growth and increaſe of Believers, and the multitude of Chriſtians, as <hi>Luke</hi> alſo in ch. 16. v. 16. expreſſeth ſaying, <hi>That the Law and the Prophets were untill Iohn; ſince that time the kingdome of God is preached, and every man preſſeth in to it:</hi> that is, the generality of the people became believers, and were baptized: as it is yet more evident from <hi>Luke</hi> 7.29, 30. by the very teſtimony of our Saviour, who ſaith, <hi>That all the people that heard him, and the Publicans, juſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of Iohn, but the Phariſees and Lawyers reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted the counſell of God againſt themſelves, being not baptized of him.</hi> So that by the witneſſe of our Saviour Chriſt, except the Phariſees and the Prieſts; all the people, or the generality of the people in Jeruſalem were baptized, and became Chriſtians, and imbraced the Goſpell: and this was accounted among the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that was wrought in thoſe dayes, and as a thing of ſpeciall obſervation, and as a matter of wonder; as we may ſee in the meſſage our Saviour Chriſt ſent unto <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptist</hi> by his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, when he bad them relate unto their Maſter, what they had ſeen and heard in the 22 Verſe; tell him ſaith he, <hi>That the blinde ſee, the lame walke, the Lepers are cleanſed, the deafe heare, and the dead are raiſed, and the poore receive the Gospel,</hi> this I ſay, was among the miracles, that the generality of the poor imbraced the Goſpel, and were baptized and made Believers: which muſt needs import a mighty multitude, and a great increaſe, or elſe it would not have been a thing of ſuch wonder, and have been ſent unto Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> as a miraculous thing; and a thing worthy to prove Chriſt himſelf to be the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> looked for; for no meer man could have wrought ſuch a work, as to draw the hearts of the people to imbrace the Goſpel, but the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> himſelf, <hi>For Paul may plant, and Apollo may water,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. but God only, the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> muſt give the increaſe; he muſt move the heart to
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:158510:18"/>imbrace the Goſpel, and to believe; for faith is the gift of God, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2. and therefore this was the wonder that the generality of the people did believe and were baptized, and this was the ſole work and operation of Chriſt, and therefore proved him to be the Prophet they looked for. And it ſtands with all reaſon that there were infinites of people in Jeruſalem that believed; and that <hi>Iohn</hi> was greatly magnified of the people, and publickly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, becauſe for a time, <hi>Herod</hi> himſelfe countenanced <hi>Iohn, Mark</hi> 6.20. <hi>and feared him, knowing that he was a juſt man and an holy, and obſerved him, and when he heard him, he did many things, and heard him gladly.</hi> And although we read not that he was baptized by <hi>Iohn,</hi> yet he highly honoured him; till <hi>Iohn</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved him, and told him, it was not lawfull for him to have his Brothers Wife. And in this interim of his ſeeming favour, we may conceive, that the Courtiers alſo and the great men would do as their Maſter did: for if we obſerve the manner of all Courts to this day, what the King does the Courtiers alſo do; if the King laugh, though there be perhaps a cauſe of mourning, they will all laugh; and if he frownes, though there be a cauſe of cheerfulneſſe and ſmiling, they will all frown; and if the King commends any man, they will all admire him; and if he hears any Miniſter glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they will all hear him willingly: and if he when he is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, be angry and diſpleaſed, and will cut off his head whom he had ſo honoured but the day before, then all the Courtiers, they will help him, and further the work: as we may ſee, not only in the example of <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> but in <hi>Haman;</hi> as ſoon as the King fround upon him, the Courtiers they covered his face, and up they truſſed him; be it right or wrong it is all one to Courtiers. But in that interim, I ſay, that <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> was in favour with the King, without doubt it annimated the people greatly to follow him, and by hearing him, many thouſand Saints were converted, and the multitudes of them were numerous, as is manifeſt from <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.5. for it is ſaid, <hi>That when he would have put him to death he feared the multitude, becauſe they counted him as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet.</hi> Here are two obſervables, the one, That he that feared not God, was afraid of his ſervants. The ſecond, that it was a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty multitude of Believers that were in Jeruſalem, for a few could not have awed the King and kept him in fear: and therefore he was forced to defer the cutting off of his head, till he had got
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:158510:19"/>to him all the ſtrength of Galilee, <hi>all his Lords and high Captains, and his chief Eſtates and Commanders, Mark</hi> 6.21. And when he thought himſelfe ſtrong enough, then he exerciſed his tyranny. Yee, when <hi>Iohn</hi> was taken away, yet the multitudes of the people continued ſtedfaſt in the faith, as we may ſee in <hi>Luke</hi> 20. by the confeſſion of the very enemies: for when our Saviour asked them concerning the baptiſme of <hi>John,</hi> whether it was from Heaven or of Men? <hi>And they reaſoned among themſelves, ſaying, if we ſhall ſay from Heaven, he will ſay, why then believed ye him not? and if we ſay of Men, all the people will ſtone us, for they be perſwaded that Iohn was a Prophet.</hi> Here by the confeſſion of the very ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, all the people, or the generality of them were Believers; and it muſt of neceſſity be a mighty multitude, that kept all the Prieſts and all the Elders that had all the power in their hands, in awe, that they durſt not ſo much as open their mouthes againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt.</hi> From all which places, and many more that might be produced, to prove, that there were ſo many Believers in Jeruſalem as could not all meet in one place or room, or in one Congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip, I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was an infinite multitude, or a mighty City of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, there they could not all meet together in one place or room, or in one Congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip, and for edification (which is required in the Churches,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26.) <hi>but of neceſſity muſt be distributed into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, and divers diviſions, that they might be all edified, and partake in all Ordinances. But in the Church of Ieruſalem, by the very baptiſme and preaching of Iohn, there were infinite multitudes, and a very City of Believers.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place or room, or in one congregation for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip, and for edification (which is required in the Church of God) but of neceſſity must be distributed into ſeverall congregrtions and aſſemblies, and divers diviſions, that they might all be edified, &amp; partake in all ordinances. For the major, it is clear, by the very light of nature, and all reaſon: for there is no one place or houſe that can contain a whole City, or infinite multitude of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers: and if any great place could contain them, they could not all be edified and partake of all the acts of worſhip. For if the very great raw-bon'd building of</hi> Pauls <hi>it ſelf were cramm'd full of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and had a Preacher of the ſtrongeſt lungs in the City, half the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:158510:19"/>people could not hear and be edified, as daily experience teelleth us; ſo that of neceſſity, if they would be edified, and partake in all the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, they muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations, and ſeverall aſſemblies.</hi> I am moſt aſſured that there were ſuch mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Believers in Jeruſalem, that five ſuch buildings as <hi>Pauls</hi> could not have contained their very bodies within their wals, much leſſe receive them, or entertain them for edification. So that for the major, I am confident there is no intelligible man will doubt of it. For the Minor, it is manifeſt from the places above produced, for our Saviour ſaith, excepting the Phariſees and the Lawyers (which were but a little handfull) all the people, or the generality of them, juſtified God, and were baptized, and were Believers. So that the concluſion from the premiſes doth neceſſarily follow. But from the former places I argue yet further after this manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was ſuch an infinite company and multitude of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and Believers, as kept a tyrannicall King in awe, and all the Magiſtrates and Elders in whoſe hands was all the power and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; and ſtruck ſuch a fear and terror into them all, that they durst not exerciſe their cruelty and tyranny over them, though they were their inveterate enemies, and deſired it: There of neceſſity the number of the Believers muſt be ſo great, as they could not all meet together in one place or room, or in one congregation, for the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and partaking in all the acts of worſhip, but if they would be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, must be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies. But in Ieruſalem there were ſuch an infinite company and multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Chriſtians and Believers, as kept Herod himſelf, the tyrant, in awe, and all the Magiſtrates and Elders, in whoſe hands was all the power and authority; and ſtruck ſuch a fear and terror into them, that they durſt not exerciſe their cruelty and tyranny over them though they were their inveterate enemies, and deſired it.</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, <hi>of neceſſity the number of the Believers was ſo great, as they could not all meet together in one place or room, or in one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the enjoying and partaking in all acts of worſhip, but if they would be edified, muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies.</hi> For the Major and Minor of this Syllogiſme, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the force of reaſon and common underſtanding, which were enough to convince any rationall creature of the truth of them: the holy Scripture it ſelf (as from the places above ſpecified, is
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:158510:20"/>manifeſt) prove them. So that none can doubt of the truth of the concluſion, but ſuch as will call in queſtion truth it ſelf. I might out of the ſeverall places above mentioned draw many more Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to prove the concluſion; but becauſe I ſtudy brevity, theſe for the preſent ſhall ſerve, to prove, That by the very bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme and Miniſtery of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> there were ſuch an infinite company of Believers in the Church of Jeruſalem, as they could not all meet together in one place or congregation, for the injoying of all the Ordinances. I will now therefore go on, to ſhew the increaſe of Believers that was made by the miracles and preaching both of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and from the ſeverall places out of the holy Scripture, frame my Arguments as out of the former to prove the ſame concluſion. <hi>Iohn</hi> 4.1, 2. <hi>Now when the Lord knew how the Phariſees had heard that Jeſus made and baptized more Diſciples then Iohn (though Ieſus himſelf baptized not, but his Diſciples)</hi> here obſerve, that where there was a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in the relation, there the Evangeliſt forthwith ſhewes it, to rectifie mens underſtandings, as where it was reported that Chriſt baptized, he ſhewes it was a miſtake, for his Diſciples on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly baptized: but where it is ſaid, that Jeſus made more Diſciples then <hi>Iohn,</hi> that is taken <hi>pro confeſſo;</hi> and it was true; for <hi>Iohn</hi> himſelf in <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>verſ.</hi> 30. had ſaid, <hi>He muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe.</hi> Chriſt therefore made many more Diſciples and Believers then <hi>John,</hi> and added daily to the Church, that was then in Jeruſalem, ſuch as ſhould be ſaved; for he came to ſave the loſt ſheep of the houſe of Iſrael, and he received all that came to him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.37. <hi>And as many as received him, to them he gave power to become the ſonnes of God, even to them that believe upon his Name, Iohn</hi> 1.12. and theſe were infinite multitudes, as we ſhall ſee by and by. In <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.31. it is ſaid, <hi>That many of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Ieruſalem believed on him;</hi> and in Verſ 40. they ſaid, <hi>Of a truth this is that Prophet.</hi> And in the ſame Chapter, when the High Prieſts ſent the Officers to apprehend Chriſt, and returning without him; and the High Prieſts demanding the reaſon why they had not brought him, the Officers replyed, ſaying, That ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver man ſpake as this man, Verſ. 47, 48. <hi>Then anſwered the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, are ye alſo deceived? Doth any of the Rulers of the Phariſces believe in him? but this people that knoweth not the Law is curſed.</hi> Take here notice of the confeſſion of the very Phariſees, exceping
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:158510:20"/>themſelves and the High Prieſts, they acknowledge that the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people believed in him. Here was increaſe upon increaſe of Chriſtians and Believers, all the people generally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in him: certainly one place could not have contained them all. And which is yet more to be obſerved; that whereas the Phariſees ſaid, none but the curſed people believed in him, and none of the Rulers; in this very Chapter we finde one Ruler one <hi>Nicodemus,</hi> Verſ. 50. none of the leaſt of the Rulers. And in <hi>Iohn</hi> 12.42. it is affirmed, <hi>That among the chief Rulers many be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved on him, but becauſe of the Phariſees they did not confeſſe him, leſt they ſhould be put out of the Synagogue.</hi> And in Verſe 11. of the ſame Chapter, it is aſſerted, <hi>That many of the Iewes went away and believed on Ieſus;</hi> here was multiplication upon multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of Believers. And in Verſ 19. <hi>The Phariſees therefore ſaid among themſelves, perceive ye, how ye prevaile nothing? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the world is gone after him.</hi> Theſe words the Phariſees ſpake in private among themſelves deliberately, and confeſt, that the world of men were turned Chriſtians; all Jeruſalem ſwarmed with Believers; without doubt all theſe could not meet in one place. And indeed through all the Evangeliſts we ſhall reade of infinite multitudes that believed in him; and the reaſon is given, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.29. <hi>Becauſe he taught them as one having authority, and not as the Scribes:</hi> and did ſuch works of wonder, and wrought ſuch miracles, as in <hi>Iohn</hi> 7.31. they confeſt, none could do but Chriſt: and in <hi>Chap.</hi> 12. <hi>Verſ.</hi> 11. it is related, that the raiſing up <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead made <hi>many believe on him,</hi> and was the cauſe that ſuch multitudes of people followed him, and did ſo highly honour him and magnifie him; and did receive him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into Jeruſalem with ſuch an acclamation, crying, <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> as in this 12 Chapter is ſpecified; and is more largely ſet downe in <hi>Matth.</hi> 21.8. where it is related, <hi>That a great multitude ſpread their garments in the way, and others cut down branches,</hi> and the people that went before, &amp; they that came after, cryed <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> &amp; ſaid, this is Jeſus the Prophet of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> they all believed in him, and confeſſed him before the world. Now our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that ſhall confeſſe me and own me before men, I will confeſſe and own him before my Father in Heaven.</hi> Here is a whole City of Believers and Confeſſors. Yea, the very children believed in him, and openly, and in the Temple cried <hi>Hoſanna.</hi> And Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:158510:21"/>allowed of their teſtimony, and avouched they did well, and accordingly as was written. And in <hi>Luke</hi> 19.47, 48. it is ſaid, <hi>That he taught dayly in the Temple, but the chief Priests and Scribes, and the Elders of the people ſought to destroy him, and could not finde what they might do; for all the people were very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to hear him.</hi> The univerſality therefore of the people by all theſe places were believers, and ſuch as followed Chriſt: So that a man may wonder, how that Jeruſalem it ſelf, though it were a mighty City, could containe ſuch multitudes of people as believed in Chriſt: ſo far improbable it is, that any one place or congregation could containe the hundreth part of them. And we may alſo gather, that the great miracles at his Suffering, and at his Reſurrection, and the apparition of ſo many that roſe from their graves and went into the holy City, made a great increaſe and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Diſciples and new Believers; ſo that the number was daily augmented; we finde no diminution: but if ſome that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Chriſt for bread, that were but Hypocrites, left following him; yet in thoſe places we read again and again of numberleſſe companies that daily came in, and believed in him. And to all this we may adde, that <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> and his Diſciples, a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his death; and Chriſt and his Diſciples, by reaſon of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of the multitudes of Believers, were forced to baptize in ſeverall places. For ſo it is in <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.23. <hi>After theſe dayes came Ieſus and his Diſciples into the land of Iudea, and there he tarried with them and baptized, and Iohn alſo was baptizing in Enon, neer Salim, becauſe there was much water there, &amp; they came and were baptized.</hi> And very reaſon will tell all men, that of neceſſity there muſt be an innumerable multitude of beleevers, (for none were Baptized but beleevers) that muſt take up an hundred preachers or thereabouts; for our Saviour had twelve Apoſtles, and 70. Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, as we may ſee in the 9. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and in the 10. chapter of the ſame book: and <hi>Iohn</hi> had alſo many Diſciples, though not ſo many as Chriſt, and all theſe were imployed in preaching the Goſpell, and many of them in working miracles and wonders; ſo that the very Devills were ſubject unto them, as they rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly confeſt to Chriſt, when they returned to give him an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of their Miniſtery. And without doubt if theſe miracles wrought ſo with the very Diſciples, they prevailed much more generally with the people to make them beleeve, ſo that infinite
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:158510:21"/>multitudes of people came in and were Baptized, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture it ſelfe informeth us. And of neceſſity, ſo many Miniſters, muſt have ſeverall places to Preach in, and ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Aſſemblies to Preach to, and ſeverall places to Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tize in: for otherwiſe there would have been great confuſion; for but one of them could ſpeak at once; and all theſe Diſciples were taken up in their ſeverall Miniſteries, and had their hands full, as the Scripture it ſelf ſufficiently declareth in expreſſe words; for it is ſaid, <hi>That Chriſts Diſciples Baptized in Iudaea; and Iohn in Enon neer Salim, becauſe there was much water there.</hi> It ſeems there was too little water to Baptize them in, in other places, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> expreſſion is worthy to be taken notice of. And amongſt thoſe that came to be Baptized, multitudes of them came from <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem.</hi> And if we compare times with times, which will make much for the evidencing of the truth, and conſider the divers paſſages in the holy Scriptures, we ſhall finde the like diviſion of the people in thoſe dayes; ſome ſtanding for Chriſt and <hi>Iohn</hi> Baptiſt, and ſpeaking in the juſtification of them and their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, and others that were of the Phariſaicall faction, and of the high prieſts company; as is even in theſe our dayes, between them they call Caviliers, and thoſe they call Parliamentiers. Now what twenty or thirty places in the City of <hi>London,</hi> can contain all the Parliamentiers to partake in all acts of Worſhip? Or what ten places can hold all thoſe of the Prelaticall faction, that contend for their Biſhops and Service, and all their other trumpery and accoutrements? And yet, although they be in divers and ſundry Aſſemblies, they are ſtill the Prelaticall party, and all of them of the Malignant Church: and as the diverſity of the places changeth not their complexions, ſo it altereth not their faith, nor manners, but they continue ſtill Malignants and remain all members of the Malignant Church. And as in theſe dayes all that wiſh well unto the true Religion through both city and kingdome, and love their Country, ſtand for the Parliament; ſo in thoſe dayes thoſe that loved <hi>Zion</hi> and the proſperity of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> cleaved unto Chriſt and the Goſpelll and ſtood for him, and all his miniſters, and by all computations, though all the power and Authority, was in the hands of the malignant Magiſtrates of thoſe times, who were ſwayed and guided by the Scribes, Phariſees, Elders, and the high Prieſts; yet to one Phariſee or Malignant Scribe or Ruler,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:158510:22"/>there was ten of thoſe that beleeved in Chriſt, and honoured him and all his Miniſters and Diſciples. Yea the Phariſees themſelves do acknowledge it, not once but many times, as is evident from the places above cited, and many more that might be produced. So that if I ſhould frame no Argument out of them, it is apparent, that thoſe new additions of beleevers that were converted by Chriſt and his Miniſtery, conſidered by themſelves a part, from thoſe that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt converted, were ſo great and nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, that they could not all meet in any one place for partaking of all acts of worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies, if they would all be edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, much leſſe could they all meet together, being joyned to thoſe that beleeved through the Baptiſme and Miniſtry of <hi>Iohn.</hi> But out of the former places above ſpecified I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, in a word, the whole people and City of Ieruſalem, whom the Phariſees accounted accurſed, there they could not all meet at any one time, and in any one room or place and in one Congregation, to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceſsity muſt be diſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies, and diverſe Congregations, if they would all be edified: But in Ieruſalem (the Scribes, Phariſees, and Rulers by their own confeſſion, being excepted) there was an innumerable multitude of beleevers, and in a word, the whole people and City of Ieruſalem, whom the Phariſees accounted accurſed.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet together at one time, and in one place to partake in all the Ordinances, but of neceſſity must be deſtributed into ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall aſſemblies and divers Congregations, if they would all be edified.</hi> For the major no rationall man will deny it, that hath but read the Scriptures, or is but a little acquainted with the Hiſtories of thoſe times. For the minor it is evident from the placed produced; and therefore the concluſion doth neceſſarily follow, But I yet further thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men of great place &amp; office, with infinite multitudes of men and children, and all the people, they could not all meet together at one time, and in one place and Congregation to pertake in all acts of worſhip; but of neceſsity muſt be diſtributed into divers aſſemblies and ſeverall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, if they would all be edified. But in the Church of Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, there was a world of beleevers, with many Rulers and men
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:158510:22"/>of great place and office, with multitudes of men and children, and all the people.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet together at one time, and in one place, to partake of all acts of worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be distributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies if they would be all edified.</hi> For the Major it is evident by the very light of nature, neither will any rationall man deny it, that hath not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to ſacrifice himſelf to ſtupidity. For the Minor, the places above ſpecified prove it: for in expreſſe words it is ſaid, that the World followed him; that is, believed in him, and that great multitudes entertained him with their acclamations, and crying <hi>Hoſanna,</hi> the very children alſo ſeconding them. And that the <hi>chief Prieſts, Scribes, and Elders, ſought to deſtroy him, and could not finde what to do, for all the people were very attentive to heare him.</hi> The whole people we ſee here, or the generality of them, except the Scribes, Phariſees, Elders, and High Prieſts, (which in compariſon of them were very few) believed in Jeſus Chriſt, and were his Diſciples, and ſuch as were converted by his miniſtery; and ſuch a multitude there was of them, as for that preſent, they ſo awed the High Prieſts and Elders, that they durſt not deſtroy Chriſt, though they deſired it; ſo that the minor ſtands firm; and from the premiſes the concluſion neceſſarily followeth. But out of the former places I yet further thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was ſuch an increaſe of multitudes of Believers, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all, nor any one place in the wilderneſſe capable to containe or receive them all; ſo that Chriſt himſelfe, and his ſeventy Diſciples, and twelve Apoſtles, and John Baptiſt and all his Diſciples, were for the numeroſity of them, forced in ſeverall places to preach unto them and baptize them; there they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place or room, or in one congregation, to partake or communicate in all acts of worſhip; but of neceſſity were distri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted into ſeverall congregations or aſſemblies, if they would all be edified. But in Jeruſalem there was ſuch multitudes of Believers that went out to the Baptiſme of Iohn and Chriſt, as that there was not water enough in any one place to baptize them all; nor any one place in the wilderneſſe capable to containe or receive them all: ſo that Chriſt himſelf and his ſeventy Diſciples, and his twelve Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and Saint John Baptist and his Diſciples, were for the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rofity of them forced to divide themſelves into ſeverall places, and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:158510:23"/>ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations, that all the people might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in all acts of worſhip, and be edified.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place, but were of neceſſity forced to divide and distribute themſelves into divers places, and ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies, that they might all be edified.</hi> For the Major and Minor of this Syllogiſm, they are ſo evident, both by reaſon, and the holy Scripture, that no man that hath not reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with himſelf to remain incredulous, and continue in his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, can deny the truth of them; ſo that the concluſion of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity muſt from the premiſes be granted. And all theſe multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of people, were believers before Chriſts Sufferings, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Aſcenſion. Now I will take a Survey of the numbers that were added to the Church, and to theſe Believers, by the powerfull preaching and miracles of the Apoſtles after Chriſts Aſcenſion. And from the divers places that I ſhall gather out of the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> frame ſuch Arguments, as ſhall make it yet more evident, that there were ſuch multitudes of Believers in the Church of Jeruſalem, as they could not all poſſibly meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at one time, and in one place or room, or in one congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to enjoy all the ordinances and partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but muſt neceſſarily be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified: and that before the perſecution we reade of in <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. and in the Perſecution, &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Perſecution. But before I come to the proof of the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, I muſt anſwer to ſome Objections, made by our Brethren the Independents; the firſt of the which is, out of the firſt Chapter of the Acts of the Apoſtles, from which they endeavour to prove, that the number and multitude of Believers in the Church of Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem was not ſo great, but that they might all meet in one room or place, and in one congregation, to partake in all acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; the words on which they ground their Argument, are theſe. <hi>And in thoſe dayes Peter ſtood up in the middeſt of the Diſciples, and ſaid (the number of the names together, were about an hundred and twenty) Men and Brethren, &amp;c.</hi> From whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the whole Church in Jeruſalem, that is to ſay, all the Believers, did meet in one place; for in this number of names they would have all the whole Church in Jeruſalem included or confined; which to me is a wonder, that ſuch Learned Men as many of them are, ſhould ſo argue: for this muſt be the ſcope of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:158510:23"/>the Argument, if they intend to prove, That the whole Church in Jeruſalem and all the Believers there, were not ſo numerous, but that they might all meet in one place, and partake in all acts of worſhip, and that theſe in <hi>Peters</hi> company were all that Church, and all the Believers that were in Jeruſalem: this, I ſay, muſt of neceſſity be their meaning, or elſe their Argument concludes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe. The invalidity of the which, I am moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident will by and by evidently appear (though all the former Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments to the contrary ſhould not ſo much as be thought of) and withall, it will alſo be obvious to any judicious man, that in all reſpects their Argument makes much againſt themſelves. For if I ſhould grant unto them, that at this inſtant of time that that place ſpeaks of, the whole Church in Jeruſalem, or the number then of Believers, were no more, but that one place might have contain'd them all for the enjoying of all Ordinances (which I cannot do, for innumerable reaſons, and ſome of them above ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified) yet it doth not follow nor evince, that after there were daily ſuch additions of Believers, and ſuch multitudes of new Converts added unto the Church, that then alſo, one place or room could containe them all; and that they might ſtill meet in one congregation, and all together partake in all acts of worſhip. For there is a vaſt difference between one hundred and twenty names (for there was no more in this aſſembly) and in many ten thouſands, which all the World knows could not be contained in any one place of Jeruſalem to communicate in all the Ordinances, though that place had equallized the moſt magnificent Structure that ever the World yet ſaw; eſpecially, they could not have all met there to edification, for they could not have all heard and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood: and we know that in the Church, all muſt be done to edification; and this would rather have hindred the mutuall edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the aſſembly, and have brought a confuſion, rather then any profit or benefit unto them. But the truth is, the number of names here ſpoken of, if we will go to the genuine interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the place, not to ſpeak of the univerſall conſent of all the learned Interpreters, who gather that in this aſſembly, the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Diſciples the Lord Jeſus ſent out to preach through all Judea, and all thoſe other Miniſters of the Goſpell that had been Chriſts, and Saint <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſts</hi> Diſciples, every one of the which was thought fit for learning and divine knowledge, to ſucceed
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:158510:24"/>
               <hi>Judas</hi> in his Apoſtleſhip and to be a Diſciple; all theſe or moſt of them, or ſuch like, were thoſe that are included in this number of names. I ſay, to omit this interpretation of all the moſt orthodox Divines, and their univerſall agreement and harmony in their lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Commentaries about this portion of Scripture, the very words themſelves following ſhew they were ſelect and eminent men, and men of note, and Diſciples of longeſt ſtanding; and all of them or the moſt of them Miniſters &amp; Preachers themſelvs; and were indeed the Presbyters of the Church, to whom with the Apoſtles, the power of ruling was committed; and who with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelves, and without the conſent of the common multitude of Believers, had power to ordaine their own Officers, and that by their own authority as we may ſee, Verſ. 21.22. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Peter, of theſe men which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jeſus went in and out among us, beginning from the baptiſme of John, unto that ſame day he was taken up from us, muſt one be ordained to be a witneſſe with us of the reſurrection. And they appointed two, &amp;c. and they prayed, &amp;c. and they gave forth the Lots, &amp;c.</hi> all buſineſſes here were managed and carried in an Ariſtocraticall and Presbyterian way, and all was done by a joynt conſent and the common counſell of them all. Here we finde none of the multitude of the people, though Believers, here were no Women that gave forth their lots. Neither doth the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſay, Men, Mothers, and Brethren; or Men, Women, and Brethren; or Men, Brethren, and Siſters; but <hi>Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren.</hi> For howſoever in the foregoing Verſes it is ſaid, that theſe (meaning the Apoſtles and Elders) <hi>all continued with one accord in prayer and ſupplication, with the women, and Mary the Mother of Jeſus, and with his Brethren,</hi> by which they fitted themſelves for the Miniſtery after they ſhould receive the Holy Ghoſt; though I ſay, they joyned with them in thoſe duties of humiliation and prayer, which any women may do, in the ſociety and compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of godly Miniſters: yet when they went about other acts of Church government, as chooſing of an Apoſtle, then the Apoſtles and Elders only by themſeves, to whom the power of the Keyes was given, ordered that buſineſſe, and left the Women to their private devotions, and their ſeverall imployments: for in this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of giving forth their lots, there is no mention of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men. And it is manifeſt from the Text it ſelf, that this chooſing
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:158510:24"/>of <hi>Matthias</hi> was at another time, and without all doubt, upon a ſet day for this purpoſe; for it is ſaid Verſ. 15. <hi>And in thoſe daies Peter ſtood up in the middest of the Diſciples, and ſaid, Men and Brethren.</hi> Here was only Diſciples, Men and Brethren, and no Siſters. Till Pope <hi>Joans</hi> time, and our dayes <hi>Peters</hi> Keyes never hung at any Womans Girdle; and we heare not in Scripture that they had any voyce in chooſing of Church-officers, and admitting of Members into the Church, or caſting out of any, till theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy times; an uſurpation not beſeeming that Sex, as afterwards in its due place I hope to make appear. But this by the way. Now to the matter in hand, I ſay it is apparent to any that will not ſhut their eyes, that all thoſe, or moſt of them that were in <hi>Peters</hi> company, and at that time met together, were capable of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, and ſuch as were the moſt eminent of all Chriſts follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and ſuch as were beſt inſtructed in Chriſtian Religion, as ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been bred up in the doctrine of Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and under the Miniſtery of Chriſt himſelf, the Prophet of his Church; and therefore they were the Teachers of the Church and people, who were their flock which they all fed in common: And from thence it argueth, that the multitude of Believers in Jeruſalem was not only a diſtinct company from them, but that it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly great and numerous, that had ſo many Paſtors and Tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers over them: for if they had been but ſo ſmall a company as is here mentioned, and that the whole Church had conſiſted but of ſixſcore names, then the Paſtors exceed the number of the flock; which is not only abſurd to think, but againſt the evident truth of the holy Scriptures, which relate unto us multitudes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on multitudes, that were daily converted by the miniſtery of <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and added unto the Church before this their meeting. So that by this I have now ſaid, it is moſt clear and evident, that all or moſt of theſe, were the moſt eminent Miniſters of the Goſpell, and the Presbytery of the Church. But in this, that our Brethren do acknowledge, that this aſſembly here ſpake of were the Church, it makes as much againſt them, and greatly for us: for it is manifeſt from the Text, that they were the Miniſters and Preachers of the Goſpel, and in that they give them the name and title of the Church, it followeth that the repreſentative body and Presbytery is a Church, and that to them only belongs the power and authority of the Keyes: ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:158510:25"/>to that of our Saviour in <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.17, 18. <hi>Tell it unto the Church, &amp;c. and whatſoever ye binde on Earth ſhall be bound in Heaven; and whatſoever ye looſe on Earth ſhall be looſed in Heaven.</hi> By which words, all authority is put into the true Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters hands; ſo that they only have the power and authority of ordaining Paſtors and Presbyters among themſelves; as <hi>Paul</hi> ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently declares in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus:</hi> and that they have not only the title of the Church, but a Charter and War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant alſo granted unto them of ruling and governing the Church, and of ordaining Church-officers, and that by joynt and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon conſent among themſelves, without the help and aſſiſtance of the people and congregations under them, which by God were never joyned in commiſſion with them.</p>
            <p>And howſoever <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> chap. 6. For the taking away the ſcandall in going to Law before unbeleevers; gave them liberty to make choyce of ſome that were leaſt eſteemed in the Church, for the deciding of their controverſies, yet that did not authorize them to make choyce of all other Church Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; for he limits them to go no farther then to the choyce of <hi>ſuch as are of leaſt eſteem.</hi> And howſoever likewiſe, the Apoſtles in the 6. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> to free themſelves from all impediments, that they might the better attend upon their Miniſteries, and that without interruption they might Preach the Goſpell, gave them liberty to chuſe their Decons and Deconeſſes: yet they preſcribe the Rule by which they ſhall chuſe them, and keep the authority of ordaining them ſtill in their own hands: <hi>Look you out among you,</hi> ſay they, <hi>men of honest report, full of the holy Ghoſt, and wiſedome, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe,</hi> and when they had choſe ſuch, ſaith the Scripture, <hi>They put them before the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and when they had prayed, they layd their hands on them.</hi> So that howſoever they gave unto them a Liberty to chuſe, yet it was with limitation, not an abſolute liberty, for if they had choſe men that had not been of approved honeſty, well gifted, and wiſe, and qualified as they appointed; it was arbitrary in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles to reject their choiſe, for they keep the power of Ordination ſtill in their own hands, and to them it did belong to ratifie their Election; ſo that the people had not the power of Ordination then, nor have not to this day, no not of the meaneſt Deacon or Deaconeſſe, that belongs onely unto the Presbytery, much leſſe
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:158510:25"/>have they power of ordaining Presbyters. Indeed for the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of controverſies and differences, they have a liberty given them of making choiſe of ſome petty men amongſt them, and that they may do without the Presbytery; but they have no power of Ordination. Neither did I ever yet read in the Sacred Scriptures that the people or Congregation had any hand at all in chooſing of Miniſters and Presbyters, neither were they fit for that imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for it is one thing to judge of a mans externall carriage and manners, and another thing of his ſufficiency for his indow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and abilities of learning, and that men of learning and knowledge onely can do, and the Sons of the Prophets; and it is in ſpeciall given in charge to the Presbyters and Miniſters, as it is manifeſt in the Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1. And they onely know how rightly to examine them, in the knowledge of the tongues and Sciences, and ſuch Arts as are requiſite, beſides the knowledge of the holy Scriptures; all which are little enough for the making of a Miniſter compleat and fit for that Sacred imployment. And all the Primitive Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Apoſtles times willingly ſubmitted themſelves to what the Presbytery then did, and aſſented to their choyce as in the 14. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 23. it appeareth. But I ſay, in that our brethren do acknowledge this company, this hundred and twenty names, to be a Church, and in that it is alſo ſufficiently manifeſt, that they are conſidered in a diſtinct notion from the people, which alſo in the holy Scriptures, when they are joyned with their Miniſters, are called a Church (as is frequently to be ſeen through the acts of the Apoſtles) and in that it doth abundantly appear, by what hath formerly been ſpoken, and will yet in the following diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be farther elucidated, that there were many congregations and Aſſemblies of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they were all governed by the joynt conſent and Common Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, to whom the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were ſubject; who were ſent this way and that way by their direction, and to whom they were to give an account of their Miniſtry, as we ſee in divers places in the <hi>Acts,</hi> and were ordered by them, what they ſhould do, and alſo made their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals unto the Apoſtles and Presbyters in any buſineſſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon concerement: I ſay, in all theſe reſpects, it is evident that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſiſted of many Congregations and
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:158510:26"/>Aſſemblies, and was yet but one Church, and that governed by a Presbyterian Government, and by a Common Councell of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to whoſe order all the ſeverall Congregations were to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit themſelves: And therefore this their Argument maketh much againſt them and greatly for us. And this ſhall ſuffice to have an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered to this their firſt Objection; which, to ſpeak the truth, is that that carrieth the moſt appearance of any Argument they produce to prove their Aſſertion and tenent: for all their other Objections raiſed from the ſeverall meetings of the Apoſtles and people, and from the multitude comming to them about the ordaining of Deacons, by which they would perſwade the world, that the company of Believers in the Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem was not ſo numerous at any time, but that they might all meet in one congregation, or in one place, to partake of in acts of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, they conſiſt moſt of them in Homonymies, and meer Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logiſmes, which indeed beſeem not the gravity of reverend men, and in the weighty matters of Divinity, would be undecent in a ſucking Sophiſter; and therefore are much more blameworthy in them, who by ſuch fallacies labour to amuſe the people, to the diſturbance of the whole Church and Kingdome, and alienating the affections of Brethren one from another.</p>
            <p>I ſhall briefly run over them. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. where it is related, that the Believers and new Converts <hi>continued daily with one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord in the Temple, and breaking bread from houſe to houſe.</hi> From theſe words the Brethren conclude, that the multitude of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers was not ſo great, but that they might all meet in one congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, and in one place, to partake in all acts of worſhip; for here in expreſſe words, the place where they met is ſpecified, and it is ſaid to be the Temple. I appeale to the wiſdome of any lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, or but of a rationall Chriſtian, whether this be a candid or ingenuous way of arguing; That becauſe three thouſand Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians might meet together in the Temple of Jeruſalem. <hi>Ergò,</hi> all that believed in Jeruſalem that were converted by <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist,</hi> and all that believed by Chriſts miniſtery and miracles, and all that were converted by the Apoſtles, and the ſeventy Diſciples before Chriſts ſufferings, and all that were after his Reſurrection converted for twenty years together, by the Miniſtry of all the Apoſtles, and all the other Miniſters of the Goſpell, they might yet all meet in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:158510:26"/>acts of worſhip, and to edification. I refer this, I ſay, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of any Learned man, or any intelligible Chriſtian, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be an ingenuous way of arguing. I believe if one ſhould argue againſt them after the ſame manner, they would laugh at him. If one ſhould thus diſpute; within theſe ſeven years, all the Independents continued daily with one accord in ſuch a place, and they all met together in one congregation: <hi>Ergò,</hi> there is but one congregation, and but one Church ſtill of Independents in <hi>London,</hi> and they all meet together in one congregation. Would not the Brethren make themſelves as merry with ſuch a way of diſputing, as they have made others ſad with their way of argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? yes doubtleſſe. The truth is, their way of arguing is not to their own honour, to ſpeak but favourably of it, as will appear. For ſhould I grant unto them, that at that time this place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks of, there had been no more Believers in Jeruſalem, but thoſe hundred and twenty names ſpecified in the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and theſe three thouſand new Coaverts; and accord alſo unto them, that all theſe did meet together in one place, and in one congregation, and did partake in all the Ordinances, which notwithſtanding I cannot grant them, for divers reaſons: for in the ſame place it is ſaid, that although they continued daily in the Temple, yet <hi>they brake bread from houſe to houſe;</hi> that is to ſay, ſome of them did daily meet to hear the Word in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and then followed their ſeverall imployments, and others in private, and they had the holy Communion or Sacrament in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall houſes; from which it is manifeltly evident, that then when there were newly added to the Church but three thouſand Believers, they had many and ſeverall congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; and without all doubt as the multitudes of Believers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, they were ſtill diſtributed into more congregations: for it is ſaid, They brake bread from houſe to houſe; that is, they had their aſſemblies and meetings in ſeverall houſes and places, beſides the Temple: and in thoſe ſeverall houſes, they had not only the preaching of the Word and Prayer, but the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, and communicated in all the Ordinances; which they could not do in the Temple, as afterward will appear: and all that I now ſay is evident from the 41 Verſe of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the 47. But I ſay, ſhould I ſilence my own reaſon, and ſuffer it to ſpeak nothing; and ſhould I grant to our Brethren,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:158510:27"/>that there were but three thouſand, and that theſe three thouſand Believers might all meet in one congregation, and partake in all the ordinances to edification: would it follow, that when ten thouſand were added unto them, and twenty thouſand more to them, and thirty thouſand more to all theſe; and it may be in a ſhort time many hundred thouſands more; would any man think or believe, that ten thouſand men can meet in one congregation to edifie, and to partake in all the Ordinances, much leſſe when there is ſo many thouſands more added to them, that they could ſtill meet in any one place or congregation? I think no man that hath not abdicated his underſtanding will ſo conclude. So that all men may ſee, not only the weakneſſe of this argumentation, but the ſtrength of truth: For this very weapon with which they had thought to have defended themſelves, and wounded the Truth, they wound themſelves, and overthrow their own tenent; as God willing, I ſhall more fully by and by make appear. But out of Chap. 5. our Brethren conceive they have a very ſtrong &amp; invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Argument: where it is related, that after <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> were miraculouſly taken away, for lying unto the Spirit of God. It is ſaid, <hi>That great fear came upon all the Church, and upon as many as heard theſe things. And by the hands of the Apoſtles were many ſignes and wonders wrought among the people, and they were all with one accord in Solomons Porch. Ergò,</hi> ſay they, the number of Believers in Jeruſalem, was not ſo great, but that they might all meet together in one congregation; for the place where they did meet, is ſet down, <hi>viz.</hi> in <hi>Solomons Porch:</hi> and it is further ſpecified, <hi>That they were all with one accord in that place.</hi> This is their Argument faithfully and truly ſet down, and with the beſt advantage for their cauſe. But to ſpeak the truth, this kinde of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guing hath no force in it, neither doth it beſeem grave men, to trifle thus, in the matters of God and Religion. For ſhould I grant unto them, that all the Believers that then were in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, and had been converted by <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and by Chriſt and all his Diſciples, before the Paſſion and Sufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the three thouſand converted by the firſt Miracle and Sermon of <hi>Peter,</hi> after they had received the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and the five thouſand after by the ſecond Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle and Sermon, and after the new additions of ſo many multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of Believers both of men and women, by reaſon of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:158510:27"/>wrought upon <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his Wife; and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther miracles that the fifth Chapter ſpeaketh of; ſhould I ſay, grant that all theſe might yet have met in one place, and in any one congregation to communicate in all the Ordinances, which all reaſon forbids me to yeild to; will it follow, that when there were additions upon additions, and that of multitudes of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, that they might ſtill meet in any one congregation to edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and have communicated in all acts of worſhip? For in all reaſon we may conceive, had we no teſtimony out of the holy Scripture to back it, that if eight thouſand were converted beſides multitudes both of Men and Women, with a few Miracles and Sermons: and if at the firſt preaching of the Goſpell after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection there was ſuch a great encreaſe, and ſuch a multiplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtians; all underſtanding, I ſay, perſwades, that in the ſpace of twenty years, there will be innumerable multitudes ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded daily to the Church, when the miraculous working of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders with the ſame doctrine ſtill continued: and with all, the ſame reaſon will dictate to any man, that then the whole multitude of all thoſe Believers could not all meet together in one place, and in one congregation for edification, to communicate in all Ordinances. So that any judicious man, without the help of any great Schoole-learning, may perceive the invalidity and vanity of ſuch argumentation. And truly were it not, that they are Brethren, and that I deſire in the ſpirit of meekneſſe to deale with them, I would have made it appear, that it is ſo poor a way of diſputing, that it did not beſſem men of gravity, much leſſe of learning; and that there were many wayes to evade the dint of ſuch reaſoning, and to prove the nothingneſſe of the Argument, and that by the words of the Text: the people there ſpake of, to be in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> are to be limited and confined within the number of thoſe that were converted by the laſt miracle, and ſome other new mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Apoſtles, which they were then working in <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons Porch;</hi> for there is the place where the Apoſtles, and they were together; and I doe acknowledge, that as many as were then, and at that time, in <hi>Solomons Porch</hi> with the Apoſtles, were of one accord. But doth this with any rationall man conclude, that every Believer in Jeruſalem, both Men and Women and all the Chriſtians and Diſciples in Jeruſalem, were then together in <hi>Solomons Porch,</hi> and in one Congregation? I am confident that
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:158510:28"/>no wiſe man will think ſo; for without all controverſie there were then ſuch multitudes of Believers in the Church of Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, as neither many Porches nor many Temples could have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained their very bodies, much leſſe could they have all met in any one congregation to edifie. But I ſay I will not deale with Brethren ſo rigidly as I might, and therefore wave many things that I might juſtly here utter. But grant it were ſo, that now in the beginning of the Chriſtian Church, and if I may ſo ſpeak in the infancy of it, that all the Believers then in Jeruſalem night all meet together in one place; doth it follow that they mighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo do in ſucceeding times, when there was ſuch infinite in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Chriſtians daily added to the Church? all reaſon will contradict that aſſertion. Within this ſeven yeares, as all men know, one place and congregation would have contained all the Independents; but will one place now or ten containe them? And there is no man as I conceive will deny, but that the Apoſtles and thoſe Primitive Miniſters, had mother manner of convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faculty then our Brethen; for the Apoſtles as it is well known did not build upon others foundations; yea, they took it as a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſparagement unto them, for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 15 of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans v.</hi> 20. affirmeth. Now our Brethen they build upon others foundations, and gather the ſheep, and them the good and the fat ſheep, with good fleeces on their backs; yea, the Vel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit-ſheep, and the Pluſh-ſheep, and the Sattin and Taffity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheep, out of other Sheepheards foulds; and while they ſeem to gather Churches, they ſcatter them, and the poor ſheep. But I will proceed to the other Argument out of the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> where it is related that when the number of Diſciples was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed (here we may take notice of multiplication) <hi>There aroſe a murmuring of the Greeks against the Hebrews, becauſe the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were neglected, in the dayly miniſtration.</hi> And the Apoſtles called the multitude of the Diſciples unto them, and gave them liberty to chooſe their Deacons, <hi>and it pleaſed the whole multitude,</hi> ſaith the Scripture. From thence our brethren conclude, that all the beleevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> came here together to the Apoſtles, and were then no more then could all meet in one congregation: as if our brethren ſhould thus argue; As the wheel-barrow goes rumble, rumble, even ſo is Prelaticall Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, better then the Presbyterian Government. But to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:158510:28"/>ſhould I grant unto the Brethren that at this time, all the beleevers that were in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> did then come together, and were all in one place, and might meet in one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; doth it follow, when there was a dayly increaſe of more beleevers, and that of multitudes of them (as this very chapter ſignifies) that then alſo they might all meet together in one place or in one Congregation? I ſuppoſe no man will think or beleeve ſo. But I muſt confeſſe, that I cannot grant unto them, that by the multitude of beleevers here ſpake of, is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood every individuall Chriſtian, or the greateſt part of them, much leſſe that all the whole body of them came together, and that for warrantable reaſon to the contrary. For the controverſie and murmuring here ſpoken of, was not among all the Diſciples and beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> but onely between two Nations of them, <hi>viz.</hi> between the Greeks and the Hebrews. Now we are informed out of the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 5. <hi>That there were dwelling in Ieruſalem Iews, devout men, out of every Nation under heaven:</hi> for ſo in expreſſe words, it is ſaid, of the which the Greeks were but one Nation, and the Hebrews another. So that all the Chriſtians and beleevers of all the other Nations, were of one minde, and in good accord among themſelves, as the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapters tell, and were at peace one wiſh another, ſo that there was no murmuring amongſt them, nor no controverſie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention or varience and they all continued quiet in their ſeverall houſes, and lived in love, and were none of that multitude here ſpoken of: ſo that of neceſſity, by the multitude in this place, we are to underſtand the Greeks onely and the Hebrews, for ſo in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words it is ſpecified: and this every rationall man can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive. Again, by multitude here is to be underſtood not a confuſed company going in a tumultuous way, but a conſiderable number of rationall men of each differing and diſſenting party, and ſuch as were called and ſent for by the Apoſtles, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſeen, in thoſe that go by way of complaint to petition to any councell, they ſend a compitent multitude of underſtanding and able men, to grace their cauſe and to mannage the buſineſſe: and not every particular and individuall perſon, men and women to negotiate it, which could not be without mighty confuſion, which was not in this multitude: and therefore <hi>by multitude, and the whol multitude,</hi> we are to underſtand, that both thoſe parties
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:158510:29"/>that came to negotiate this buſineſſe, were well ſatisfied with the Apoſtles Order, and obeyed it: but from hence if any man would infer and conclude, that every one of the beleeving Hebrews, and every individuall beleeving Greek, that was then in <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> and that all the Greek Church and all the Hebrew Church, both men and women, not one perſon excepted, were all in one place together before the Apoſtles, the whole world would judge, that this man that ſhould thus argue, were very much craſed in his brain: but much more would it argue a great imbecility of wit and judgement in any one, to conclude that all the beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> were there: And unleſſe they can ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, the Argument is nothing to the purpoſe, nor of any validity to evince and prove the Aſſertion of our brethren. But if I ſhould yeeld unto the brethren, theſe two things; the firſt, That all the beleeving Greeks and all the beleeving Hebrews, none excepted, were all before the Apoſtles in one place: yet ſtill this will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that all the beleevers of every ſeverall Nation were not in this multitude and number: for they had nothing to do in the buſineſſe, for they were no parties; ſo that the Argument is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe, but a meer fallacy to delude unſtable ſouls, and to make them beleeve that bladders are Lanthorns. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, ſhould I grant unto the brethren, that by <hi>multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude here, and by the whol multitude,</hi> all the beleevers then in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> were to be underſtood, and that then they might all meet in one congregation: doth it therefore follow, that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years after, when there was daily ſuch additions of multitudes of Believers, that they might all ſtill meet together in one place, and in one congregation for all acts of worſhip, and to be edified? I believe our Brethren themſelves the Independents will not grant it; yet they muſt grant it if they will ſtand to their princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples. But fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this murmuring between the Greeks &amp; the Hebrews I, with very good reaſon, can frame an Argument to overthrow our Brethrens tenent, and may from thence gather, that in the Church of Jeruſalem there were many and ſeverall congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where they had all acts of worſhip; and that every ſeverall nation had their ſeverall congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies, where they might heare the Word of God in their own lauguage and to edification, and communicate in all Ordinances with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort. For if there ſhould ariſe a controverſie in <hi>London,</hi> between
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:158510:29"/>the <hi>Dutch</hi> and the <hi>French,</hi> about points of Religion, or about a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other matter of practice concerning Religion; &amp; they ſhould all apply themſelves to the grave and learned Aſſembly for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of it; would not all men gather that there were two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct congregations of them in the City? So it may well be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded againſt our Brethren, that every ſeverall Nation of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Jeruſalem, had their ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies apart, (as well as the Greeks and the Hebrews) where they might partake in all Ordinances to edification, and underſtand their Miniſters preaching to them in their own language. As for my part, I verily believe it was ſo, and from warrantable reaſon: and yet all theſe ſeverall congregations made but one Church, and were under one Presbytery: and for this my belief I ſhall give my reaſons in the enſuing diſcourſe. But had there been but one Nation in Jeruſalem, ſo many thouſand Believers as the Scripture relates there was, could not all have met in one place, and in one congregation, as all reaſon will perſwade. So that all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Brethren to the contrary, are but as ſo many Squibs which only make a noiſe, and then vaniſh in the aire; to ſay no more. And theſe are the moſt rationall objections that as yet I ever heard from them, to the which I have briefly given my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall anſwers, which I hope by Gods aſſiſtance I ſhall ever be able to make good againſt them all. And now I will go on to prove, that by the miniſtery of the Apoſtles, and the divers mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles daily wrought by them, after they had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, there were ſuch additions of multitudes of Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers to thoſe that were converted by Saint <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and our Saviour and his Diſcples, before the death of <hi>John</hi> and the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings of our Saviour, as that they could not all meet at any one time &amp; in one place or congregation, to partake in all Ordinances; no, nor in a few; but were of neceſſity forced to be diſtributed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations, and that before the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, under the Perſecution, &amp; after the perſecution. And for proving of what I lay down, which is ſtill but the firſt concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on I undertook to make good, I will begin with the firſt eight Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and then go forward to the enſuing ſtory of the ſame Book in order, to prove my aſſertion. In the 2, 3, 4, 5, &amp; 6 Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> it is related how the holy Apoſtles imployed themſelves in their ſeverall miniſteries, after they had
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:158510:30"/>received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and were indued with al power of working miracles, and had received the gifts alſo of tongues and languages, and the effects alſo of their miniſtery, preaching, and miracles, are there ſet down at large: and it is ſpecified, that by meanes of that firſt miracle, when all the people of ſeverall Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons heard the Apoſtles ſpeak to them, every one in their ſeverall tongues and languages (who were very well known to be <hi>Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leane</hi>) that they were amazed to hear the wonderfull Works of God, and from their amazement it is ſaid, they gave attention to the Sermon of <hi>Peter;</hi> the Sermon it ſelf being there ſet down, and the effect of it, which was, <hi>That when they had heard it, they were prickt in their heart, and ſaid unto Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles, Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do? Then Peter ſaid unto them, Repent and be Baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt, for the remiſſions of ſins; and ye ſhall receive the gift of the Holy Ghoſt, &amp;c. Then they that gladly received his word were baptized: and the ſame day were added unto them about three thouſand ſouls. And they continued ſtedfaſt in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles Doctrine and fellowſhip, and in breaking of bread, and prayer. And feare came upon every ſoule: and many ſignes and wonders were done by the Apoſtles: and all that believed were together, and had all things common: and they continuing daily with one accord in the Temple; and breaking bread from houſe to houſe, did eat their meat with gladneſſe and ſingleneſſe of heart, prayſing God, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving favour with all the people. And the Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould he ſaved.</hi> Here we ſee, that by vertue of one Miracle and Sermon (God working with them) were added to the Believers, that Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and Chriſt and his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples had converted, and ſuch as were formerly baptized, three thouſand more; a great Miracle: all which, with the many other that were converted afterward, are called but one Church. For it is expreſly ſaid, that the <hi>Lord added to the Church daily ſuch as ſhould be ſaved.</hi> We heard of the great multitudes, and of a world of ſuch as believed in Chriſt, before this Miracle and Sermon. And can any man in reaſon conceive, that all theſe could meet in any one place or congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip? But let us go on. In the 3 and 4 Chapter, by means of that Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle that was wrought upon the Impotent Man, who was known to all the people to have bin a Cripple from his Mothers wombe;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:158510:30"/>and through the powerfull preaching of <hi>Peter,</hi> who exhorted <hi>them to repent and to be converted, that their ſinnes might be blotted out, when the time of refreſhing ſhould come from the preſence of the Lord, &amp;c.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>that many which heard the Word believed;</hi> and the number of thoſe new Believers is there ſpecified, to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five thouſand men, which were alſo added unto the Church, and joyned to all the former Believers; ſo that we have here eight thouſand new Members added unto the Church, in a very little time: and this was a greater Miracle then the former. So that the Propheſie in the 110 <hi>Pſalme,</hi> verſ. 3. was not fulfilled; <hi>That in the day of Chriſts power, his willing people from the wombe of the morning ſhould be multiplyed as the Dew upon the Earth.</hi> And which is not to be paſſed by without due notice, It is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the beſt Interpreters, and the moſt orthodox Writers, (and there is good reaſon for it) that theſe new Converts were Men, not Women and Children. And without doubt, theſe new Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers endeavoured to convert, their Wives, Children, Servants, and Neighbours: and there is good reaſon alſo why we ſhould be induced to believe, that Truth, with ſuch wonders and miracles annexed to it, ſhould be as prevalent to convert Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Servants, and Neighbours, and whole Families; as errors and novelties, in theſe our dayes, are able to miſ-leade thoſe poore creatures, that are ever learning, and never come to knowledge; and the which are carried about with every winde of doctrine, and believe every new-born truth (as they tearm it) and follow every New Light, and every new-found way, though it tend to the confuſion of the Church and Kingdome. It is ſaid <hi>of that man of Sinne, that Sonne of Perdition, that he ſhall come after the working of Satan, with all power and ſignes and lying wonders, and with all deceiveableneſſe and unrighteouſneſſe in them that periſh, becauſe they received not the love of the truth, that they might be ſaved.</hi> 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2. But to ſee people <hi>ſo deluded without Miracles, is a Miracle.</hi> So that thoſe poor Women that are carried about with every winde of doctrine, from that truth that was taught by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and confirmed by ſo many Miracles; and thoſe that do and have miſ-led them, have all of them a great deal to anſwer for. But this I ſpeak by the way, conceiving that all thoſe new Converts would endeavour, as the good <hi>Samaritan</hi> Woman did after converſion, not only to bring their Wives,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:158510:31"/>Children, and Families, but their Neighbours alſo, and whole Cities to the ſame faith. And I have that opinion alſo of all the Women and people of that Age, that they were as ready to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the truth, as the Women and people of this Age and in theſe our times are to follow errors. But let us now ſee what effects the other Miracles wrought upon the people that are related in the fifth Chapter; as of <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> his wife, who <hi>for tempting the Spirit of God, were both ſtricken down dead and gave up the ghoſt;</hi> and the other Miracles wrought by the Apoſtles. It is ſaid in Verſ. 11. <hi>That fear came upon all the Church, and to as many that heard theſe things</hi> (and that to the reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the Scribes and Phariſees, the Malignant party) <hi>durſt no man joyne himſelfe. And Believers were added unto the Lord, multitudes, both men and women:</hi> Here come in the good Women now. And in Verſ 26. it it is ſaid, <hi>that the Captaine, with the Officers, brought the Apoſtles without violence (for they feared the people, least they ſhould have stoned them.)</hi> It will not be amiſſe briefly to take notice of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall effects theſe Miracles wrought. The firſt is, that great fear of offending God came on all the Church, Gods own people; which notwithſtanding of the many additions of Believers is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſtill but one Church. The ſecond, that none durſt joyne themſelves to the contrary party, the Phariſaicall malignant crew. The third, that Believers were added to the Church, and that multitudes no ſmall companies both of Men and Women. Here is a new increaſe, and that a great one. The fourth is, that the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Captain and Officers were awed and kept in fear, by reaſon of the multitude of Believers: ſo that thoſe that feared not God were afraid of his ſervants. By which it may be gathered, that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Believers did ballance the number of the incredulous and Phariſaicall party, if not by far exceed them. And therefore by all probability, muſt needs be an innumerable company and a mighty multitude; and ſuch a number as could not all meet in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one place or congregation, to partake in all the Ordinances. And to ſay nothing of the diverſity of Tongues and Languages which were not given to the Apoſtles to be uſeleſſe and of no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit; nor to ſpeak any thing of the divers Jewes that were then dwelling at Jeruſalem, devout Men and Women, out of every Nation under Heaven; which notwithſtanding may be a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent argument to prove that they all had their ſeverall meeting pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:158510:31"/>and their ſeverall Miniſters to preach unto them in their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Languages, that they might be edified. I ſay, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to wave all this, let us take notice what is poſitively ſet down in the laſt Verſe of the fifth Chapter, that is, that <hi>the Apoſtles daily in the Temple and in every houſe, ceaſed not to teach &amp; preach Jeſus Christ.</hi> That is to ſay, they preached both publickly and privately, and the very places where they preached are ſet down, as in the Temple, and in every houſe. So that of neceſſity, there muſt be ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies of Believers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> according to that in the 2. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. the 46. where it ſaid, <hi>That they continued dayly with one accord in the Temple, and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> which by all Interpreters is underſtood the adminiſtration of the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per: and that the ſeverall aſſemblies and congregations were wont uſually to meet in private houſes, is frequent mention in the holy Scriptures, as in the 16. of the <hi>Romans</hi> verſe the 5. and in the 1. of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> chap. 16. verſ. 19. <hi>Col.</hi> 4.14. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſ. 20. ſaith, <hi>That he kept back nothing that was profitable unto them, but taught them publikely and from houſe to houſe,</hi> ſo that they had their Aſſemblies as well private as publicke, even in the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> where they did par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in all acts of worſhip; and in that Church alſo they had many Presbyters, and yet were but one Church. But now I will paſſe on to the ſixth chapter, where in the 1, 2, 3, and 7, verſes it is ſaid, <hi>That in thoſe dayes, when the number of Diſciples was multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed, there aroſe a murmuring of the Grecians against the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews, becauſe their widdows were neglected in their dayly mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration. Then the twelve called the multitude of the Diſciples un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and ſaid, It is not reaſon that they ſhould leave the Word of God and ſerve tables. Wherefore brethren look you out among you ſeven men of honest report, and full of the holy Ghoſt and wiſdome, whom we may appoint over this buſineſſe. But we will give our ſelves continually to prayer and to the miniſtery of the Word,</hi> verſ. 7. <hi>And the Word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Ieruſalem greatly, and a great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of the Prieſts were obedient unto the faith.</hi> In the which words, we may take notice briefly of theſe obſervables. The firſt, of the cunning and policy of the Devill, who when he cannot by all his wiles and ſtratagems aſſault the Church without, then
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:158510:32"/>he labours to aſſaile it within, as here with civill diſcords and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences among brethren: and in other Churches in all ages, even in, and from the Apoſtles times, by diſſentions in opinions, by Sects, Schiſms, Factions, and Hereſies; and by theſe his wiles and craft, he firſt bringeth in difference in opinion, and afterwards diverſity of affection, and that among brethren; and all this he doth, that in fine, he may bring ruine upon them all. And thus he began with the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> raiſing a controverſie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Hebrews and the Greeks, who complained, <hi>That their widdows were neglected in the dayly miniſtration;</hi> as either that they were not made Deaconeſſes, as the widdows of the Hebrews were, or that there was not an equall diſtribution of the Almes, according to the intention of the Church, who ſold their poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and goods to that end, that they might be parted to all men, as every one ſhould have need, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. <hi>verſ.</hi> 44, 45. <hi>chap.</hi> 4. <hi>v.</hi> 35. And this their ſuppoſition was the cauſe of that controverſie. The ſecond abſervable, is, To whom the differing and diſſenting parties did apply themſelves and appeal; and that was to the Presbytery or Colledge of Apoſtles, not to any one of them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, but to the twelve; as in that difference at <hi>Antioch, Acts</hi> 15. <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> and certain other of the Brethren in the Church of <hi>Antioch</hi> appealed to the Apoſtles and Presbyters, and in both thoſe differences all the Churches ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Apoſtles Order, and that willingly: and this exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Apoſtles, is the Rule for ordering of all controverſies that all the reformed Churches ſet before them; deciding all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates in Religion by the Word of God, and according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident they have laid down unto them, by the Apoſtles and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Here I ſay, the whole Presbytery and Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Apoſtles determined the buſineſſe; neither do we reade, that the Aſſemblies of the Hebrews and Greeks at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> or the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> pretended their own Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent authority, though ſeverall Congregations, or challenged a power within themſelves, of chooſing their own Officers, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining of differences amongſt themſelves, or pleaded that they had Authority within themſelves, to make their own Laws by which they would be ordered, or that they challenged any ſuch priviledges unto themſelves, but they all appealed unto the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as the ſupreameſt Eccleſiaſticall Court, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:158510:32"/>freely ſubmitted themſelves to their arbitrament, and to the Order they ſet down, as the ſtory ſpecifieth. The third obſervable is, the imployment in which the Apoſtles were all taken up, and the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of it; and their imployment is ſaid to be continuing in prayer and the Miniſtery, and preaching of the Word; and the effect of this their Miniſtery was, <hi>That the Word of God increaſed, and the number of the Diſciples multiplyed in Ieruſalem greatly, and a great company of the Prieſts were obedient to the faith.</hi> By all which it is moſt apparent, that ſuch multitudes being dayly added to the Church, and where there was ſuch variety of teachers, and ſo many Apoſtles, and all of them taken up in preaching; and where there was ſo many different Nations, and ſuch diverſities of tongues and languages as was in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place to edification; and that they might all communicate in all the Ordinances, but of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into ſeverall Congregations and Aſſemblies; if they would avoyde confuſion; and all that I now ſpeak is evident by the very light of Nature and all reaſon, and therefore it followeth, That there were many Aſſemblies and Congregations in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and yet all made but one Church, and that that Church was Presbyterianly governed. But that I may make this truth more evidently yet appear, I will firſt out of the former diſcourſe frame ſeverall Arguments, and then go on to the enſuing hiſtory. And out of all theſe ſix <hi>chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there were eight thouſand new converts, beſides women and children, by virtue of ſome few miracles and Sermons, after Chriſts Reſurrection added to the Church of Ieruſalem, and the ſociety of beleevers, beſides thoſe that were converted by Iohn the Baptiſt and Chriſt and his Apoſtles Miniſtery, before his ſufferings; and to the which alſo there were afterwards great multitudes of Beleevers both of men and women, and a great company of the Prieſts joyned; in ſo much that they kept the very Officers and Souldiers in awe, and ſtruck a fear and terrour into them: there they could not all meet together in any one place or congregation, to partake in all acts of Worſhip, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies and Congregations. But in the Church of Ieruſalem there were eight thouſand new converts, beſides women and children, by virtue of ſome few miracles and Sermons after Chriſts Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:158510:33"/>added to the Church and ſociety of Beleevers, beſides thoſe that were converted by Iohn the Baptiſt, and Christ and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Ministry, before his ſufferings; and to which alſo there were afterwards great multitudes of Beleevers both of men and women, and a great company of Prieſts alſo joyned; inſomuch as they kept the very Officers and Souldiers in awe, and ſtruck a fear and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour into them. Ergò, They could not all meet together in any one place or Congregation, to partake in all acts of worſhip, but of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity must be diſtributed into divers Aſſemblies and Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons if they would all be edified.</hi> For the major it is ſo evident, that I cannot beleeve that any rationall man will deny it: for who yet did ever ſee an Aſſembly of above ten thouſand people in any one place or Congregation, that could partake in all the Ordinances to edification? Yea, to affirme this, is to fight againſt common reaſon and dayly experience. For the minor it is proved by the ſeverall places above quoted, and therefore the concluſion doth alſo of neceſſity follow. Again, I thus further argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there was almost an hundred Preachers and Miniſters, beſides the twelve Apoſtles, and all theſe continually taken up in prayer and preaching, and could not leave their miniſtery to ſerve Tables; and where there was ſuch a company of Believers and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as did imploy them all; there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into divers congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified and avoide confuſion, and partake in all Ordinances. But in the Church of Jeruſalem there was almoſt an hundred Preachers and Ministers, beſides the twelve Apoſtles; and all theſe were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually taken up in prayer and preaching, and could not leave the Miniſtery to ſerve Tables; and where there was ſuch a company of Believers and people as did imploy them all: therefore of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity they muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations &amp; aſſemblies, if they would all be edified, and avoide confuſion, and partake in all Ordinances.</hi> For the Major, very reaſon and the common light of underſtanding, without any reluctation will aſſent unto it. And for the Minor, it is manifeſt from Chap. 1. Verſ. 21, 22. and from Chap. 6. Verſ. 2. &amp; 4. Chap. 8. Verſ. 1. ſo that the concluſion is undeniable. Again I thus further argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there were people of all Nations under the Heavens, and the in ſome multitudes, and moſt of them Believers, and devout Men and Women, which waited upon the Ordinances, and had a deſire
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:158510:33"/>daily to heare the Word; there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into diverſe and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, and have ſuch to preach unto them ſeverally in their own language; or elſe they could not partake in all acts of worſhip to edification. But in the Church of Jeruſalem there were people of all Nations under the Heavens, and them in ſome multitudes, and moſt of them Believers and devout Men and Women, that waited upon the Ordinances, and had a deſire daily to heare the Word.</hi> Ergo, <hi>of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies, and have ſuch to preach unto them ſeverally in their owne language, or elſe they could not partake in all acts of worſhip to edification.</hi> For the Major, no reaſon can gainſay it, for the Apoſtles and the other Miniſters imployed all thoſe gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, and thoſe divers languages which they had received for the edification of the Church, to the utmoſt, &amp; did improve all opportunities for the converting of the people committed unto their charge, and for the further building of them up in their holy faith, which was their calling and imployment: and this they could not have done, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe they taught thoſe Nations in their ſeverall Languages; and that they could not do without confuſion, unleſſe they were diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted in ſeverall aſſemblies, where they might diſtinctly heare their own Languages. For otherwiſe, as Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.23. if men ſhould ſpeak to the people with unknown tongues, <hi>if the unlearned,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>come in and unbelievers, will they not ſay, that they are all mad?</hi> And therefore Tongues are given for a ſigne, not to them <hi>that believe, but to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve not.</hi> Now they were devout Men in Jeruſalem and Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers; and therefore the Apoſtles and Miniſters were to ſpeak to them ſeverally in their own languages: and for that purpoſe God gave them thoſe Tongues, &amp; that diverſity of Languages, that thoſe that were Believers might be more edified, <hi>and that the unbelievers and unlearned, and ſuch as belonged unto Gods election, might be convinced and judged of all; and that the ſecrets of their hearts might be manifested, that ſo falling downe upon their face they might worſhip God, and report that God was in them of a truth,</hi> as the Apoſtle there ſaith. So that I ſay for the Major, no reaſonable creature will call it in queſtion. And for the Minor, it is manifeſt out of the Chap. 2. Verſ. 5. &amp;c. and in Chap. 6. Verſ. 1. and Verſ. 2, 4. And for the concluſion, that from the Premiſes doth alſo
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:158510:34"/>enſue. Againe, I thus further argue out of the former Chapters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That which the holy Scripture in expreſſe words and in diverſe places hath declared unto us, that every Chriſtian is bound to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve: but the Scripture in expreſſe words and in diverſe places hath declared unto us, that there were diverſe aſſemblies and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of Believers in the Church of Ieruſalem, and that the Apoſtles and all the Believers in Ieruſalem, did continue daily with one accord in the Temple; and that they brake bread from houſe to houſe, and that daily in the Temple, and in every houſe, they ceaſed not to teach and preach Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Ergo, <hi>there was diverſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations and ſeverall aſſemblies of Believers in the Church of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, where they did daily partake in all the Ordinances, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed all acts of worſhip.</hi> For the Major, no Chriſtian can deny it. For the Minor, it is manifeſt from 46 Verſe of the 2 Chapter, and Chap. 5. v. 12. &amp; v. 42. &amp; Chap. 3. v. 12, 13. and many more places that might be produced. And in thoſe places it is not only ſaid they preached in every houſe, <hi>but that they brake bread from from houſe to houſe;</hi> by which expreſſion all Writers interpret, the holy Communion, and partaking of the Lords Supper: and if it ſhould not ſo be underſtood, we never can reade that any Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> beſides the Apoſtles, ever enjoyed all acts of worſhip, eſpecially thoſe that are peculiar to Church Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is related often that they preached the Word dayly in the Temple, which was common to <hi>Iews</hi> and Chriſtians (though no Jewiſh worſhip) as all men acknowledge. And by evident Arguments it may be proved, that they never adminiſtred the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in the Temple, thoſe diſcriminating and diſtinguiſhing Ordinances of the Chriſtian Church; as all the moſt Orthodox Interpreters gather from the enſuing words, where it is ſaid, <hi>They continued dayly with one accord in the Temple,</hi> but when they ſpeake of the Adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, it is expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words, <hi>and breaking of bread from houſe to houſe,</hi> which is interpreted by all Divines, of Sacramentall bread; which phraſe and manner of ſpeaking is uſually ſo expounded by all the Learned, upon <hi>Acts</hi> the 20. <hi>verſ.</hi> the 7. And our Brethren do not deny this. And it is well known, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians had their meetings and aſſemblies in private houſes, as by the many places is manifeſt, which I cited but a little before. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Sacrament of breaking bread is no Temple-ordinance;
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:158510:34"/>and therefore could not be adminiſtred in the Temple with the ſafety of the Chriſtians and Believers: for if they were ſo highly diſpleaſed with the Apoſtles, for preaching Jeſus and the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, in the Temple, as it appeareth <hi>Act.</hi> 4.2. They would not have ſuffered them to have adminiſtred the Sacraments there. And if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo aſſaulted, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.28. for being but ſuppoſed to have brought Greeks into the Temple, what would theſe men have done, if one ſhould have brought in a new Ordinance, and a new worſhip and ſervice; and that ſo contrary to their legall rights? Surely the Jewes would never have ſuffered it, neither do the Brethren contend for this. Now it is well known that in the Primitive Church, if not every day, yet every firſt day of the Week at leaſt, they met together to break bread; that is, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the holy Sacrament, which never was without preaching, as we ſee in <hi>Act.</hi> 20.7. and in the places above quoted: in which it is ſaid, they daily brake bread together, and that in ſeverall and particular houſes; and that of neceſſity muſt be, for a few houſes could not have held ſo many thouſands, as all reaſon will dictate: and if they were or could be contained under one roof, yet they muſt be forced to be in diverſe and ſeverall chambers or roomes. So that what is done and ſpoke in the one, the other knowes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of it, ſo that they are ſtill ſeverall congregations: as under the roof of <hi>Pauls,</hi> there are diverſe meeting-places where Men may partake in all Ordinances, and they are called ſeverall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and they that meet there ſeverall congregations, though under one roof: for the diſtinction of the places under one covert, makes alwayes a diſtinct aſſembly, as it is daily ſeen in the ſeverall Committes at Weſtminſter; where every Committee of both Houſes have their ſeverall rooms and equall authority, and are yet all but one Parliament, though diſtributed into ſo many ſeverall aſſemblies. So here, they had ſeverall aſſemblies, and that in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall houſes, as is declared: and reaſon it ſelf, without any teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of holy Scripture will perſwade this: for the Apoſtles they all preached, and that daily; and they muſt have ſeverall rooms to preach in, to avoide confuſion: for all things in the Church muſt be done in order, and they muſt have ſeverall auditories or aſſemblies, or elſe they ſhould preach to the wals: ſo that if the Apoſtles would all preach, and the people all heare, of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into ſeverall congregations &amp; aſſemblies,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:158510:35"/>to avoid diſorder; and that there were ſeverall congregations and ſeverall aſſemblies, the places above ſpecified do declare and tell us. So that there is no man, that reſolves not to oppoſe all truth that is contrary to his received opinion, but may evidently perceive that there were many congregations and aſſemblies in the Church of Jeruſalem, and yet they all made but one Church, and were govern'd by one Presbytery; as the many Committees in both Houſes are in divers rooms, and make divers aſſemblies, and have equall power and authority among themſelves; and yet they all make but one Parliament; and all thoſe ſeverall Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittes are govern'd by the joynt conſent of the Great Civill Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of the Kingdome, which is all the Parliament, and all this without confuſion, yea, with moſt excellent order and decency.</p>
            <p>Having thus evidently proved that there were many congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Church of Jeruſalem before the Perſecution: I will now by Gods aſſiſtance make good, that there were alſo many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies under the Perſecution, and after the Perſecution: and this I do the rather undertake, becauſe ſome of the Brethren have ſaid; That howſoever it could be proved that before the Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there were many ſeverall aſſemblies; yet by reaſon of the diſperſion of the Believers, the Church of Jeruſalem was ſo wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted and ſcattered, that there were no more left then could all meet in one congregation. And were it ſo, that after the ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of the Believers and Chriſtians in Jeruſalem, it could never be evinced and made good, that there were more then could meet altogether in one place: yet all this were nothing for the enervating of the Argument: for we muſt ever look upon the firſt conſtitution and Government of the Church, and what it was Originally and by Divine conſtitution, and not what it was acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentally and through perſecution and oppreſſion, and by the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of men: for Governments of Churches are often changed from their primordiall State through many caſualties as it happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned often in the Church of the Jews: and therefore in all Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations things are to be reduced to the firſt rule and originall pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern: and we are not to look upon them, as by occaſion they vary or change through the injury of the times. And therefore if we look into the Church of Jeruſalem, as ſhe was in her youth and in her moſt flouriſhing age, we ſhall finde her conſiſting of divers Congregations, and many aſſemblies, and all them governed
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:158510:35"/>by a Common Councell and joynt conſent of a Presbytery, which muſt be the pattern of all Church Government to the end of the world, if we will in our Reformation conform our ſelves to Gods Ordinance and to the firſt conſtitution. But becauſe I ſay they think it ſo difficult a thing to prove many Congregations in Jeruſalem after the perſecution, I will now God-willing make it evident, and not onely after the perſecution, but even in, and under the perſecution: and I will do it firſt out of that very place our brethren bring againſt us, and by which they labour to evince the contrary: the place is in the 8. of the <hi>Acts</hi> verſe 1, 2, 4. In theſe words, <hi>And at that time there was a great perſecution againſt the Church which was at Ieruſalem, and they were all ſcattered abroad through the Regions of Iudea and Samaria, except the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> verſe 3. <hi>As for Saul he made havock of the Church, entring into every houſe and haling men and women, committed them to priſon. Therefore they that were ſcattered abroad, went every where preaching the word:</hi> From whence the brethren gather, that there were no more beleivers left, than could meet in one Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Before I come to prove my Aſſertion, I muſt give ſome Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to evince and make good, that this diſperſion and ſcattering of the Beleivers here ſpake of, was not ſo generall and univerſall and ſo great, as that there might not yet remain more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Jeruſalem, and more people then could poſſibly meet in any one place or two: for perſecution is the bellows of the Goſpell, which blows every ſpark into a flame: ſo that this their diviſion proved their multiplycation at home and abroad, as we ſhall ſee after I have ſet down my Arguments and Reaſons, ſo that it was no cauſe, why we ſhould conceive that there were fewer aſſemblies in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then before; for although I ſhould grant that this perſecution was very great in reſpect of the intention of the perſecutors, as reaching to impriſonment and death of all ſorts, chap. 22. verſe 4. and although I ſhould like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe accord, that in regard of the extent of it, it reacheth to all ſorts both Preachers and Chriſtians, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>They were all ſcattered abroad through all the Regions, &amp;c. except the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles,</hi> both which notwithſtanding I cannot yeeld unto for ſome reaſons following: but I ſay ſhould I grant all this, yet I affirm that this perſecution rather made more Congregations in <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:158510:36"/>then fewer then there were before, though they might be ſmaller and leſſer, then ſo, to waſt them and bring them to ſuch a paucity, as they might all meet in one Congregation: for this their diviſion was a cauſe of their multiplication at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, as I ſaid before, and will afterwards appear. And even as it was here in <hi>England</hi> in the time of the Prelates power, when any aſſembly of thoſe they called Puritans, were at any time found to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, they were haled before Authority, (as the whole Kingdome can witneſſe) and theſe people were all ſcattered; yet ſo, as they ſtill had their meetings in leſſe numbers; and whereas before they met perhaps a hundred in a company, now this hundred was divided into three or four ſeverall aſſemblies, which were ſo many ſeverall Churches, for in all theſe they enjoyed all the acts of worſhip, and did partake in all the Ordinances as fully, as if they had been in the moſt crowded aſlemblies; but this they did for their own ſafety, and that there might not be ſuch notice taken of them: for commonly if men ſee a good company of people goe into a houſe, and none of them come out again, they will by and by gather, that there is ſomething there to be done, more than ordinary; and that there is ſome exerciſe of Religion, or ſome conſultation and plotting about ſome deſign or other; and therefore it ſtirs up the people to take more notice of it, and then they begin to examine the occaſion of that concourſe, and to pry into their proceedings: whereas, if they come but in ſlender companies, they conceive it to be ſome ordinary entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and think no farther of it; ſo that they then more peaceably enjoy the ſociety and fellowſhip one of another, without any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption, which they could not ſo well have done, if they had come in greater aſſemblies and companies. And even ſo it was among the Beleivers and Chriſtians in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> in that perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they could not now meet in the Temple, nor poſſibly at their wonted meeting houſes, and yet even then they had their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies; no terrors could make them forſake the companying of themſelves together. For in that perſecution that is ſpoken of in the 12. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> we finde the Church aſſembled in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall places; for they were praying in the houſe of <hi>Mary, verſe</hi> 12. there was one Congregation, to which <hi>Peter</hi> comes and relates unto them the manner of his delivery, and bids them go and tell it <hi>Iames</hi> and the brethren; and there was another aſſembly, and
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:158510:36"/>without doubt <hi>Peter</hi> went unto a third: for he would not goe among the enemies: and it ſtands with all reaſon, that in this perſecution alſo, they were as zealous as then, and therefore did not forſake the aſſembling of themſelves together. Neither would the Apoſtles be idle, who gave themſelves continually to prayer and the miniſtring of the Word, which they could not have done if there had been but as many Chriſtians in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> as could all have met in one place and in one Congregation; for one or two of the Apoſtles could have preacht unto them all, and then to what end or purpoſe did all the other Apoſtles tarry in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> (who in all their motions and ſtayes, were directed by the Spirit of God) unleſſe it were to comfort and ſupport the Church there, in the heat and rage of this perſecution, when they had ſcattered their other teachers from them? From all which it may evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear, that there was a very great multitude of beleevers at this time in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and that they were not diminiſhed or ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, though all their Paſtors and miniſters, ſaving the Apoſtles, were. And I have very good reaſon to induce me to beleeve, that this perſecution did not extend to all Chriſtians promiſcuouſly, and that all the beleevers were ſcattered and diſperſt except the Apoſtles, as our brethren conceive. For if we conſider the uſuall method of the perſecuting <hi>Jews,</hi> and the manner and cuſtome of all the enemies of the Church in all ages, we ſhall ever obſerve that they chiefely aymed at the taking away and extirpating of their teachers and miniſters, and thoſe that inſtructed them. So the <hi>Jews</hi> malice was greateſt againſt the Prophets in all ages, as we may ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 12. <hi>For ſo they perſecuted the Prophets:</hi> and in the 23. of <hi>Matthew,</hi> our Saviour ſaith, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. <hi>Woe unto you Scribes and Phariſees hypocrites, becauſe ye build the tombes of the Prophets, and ſay, if we had lived in the dayes of our Fathers, we would not have been partakers with them of the blood of the Prophets; and therefore ye witneſſe unto your ſelves, that ye are the children of them which killed the Prophets. Wherefore behold I ſend unto you Prophets, and wiſe men, and Scribes, and ſome of them you ſhall kill and crucifie, &amp;c.</hi> Here our Saviour Chriſt declares what method they had formerly uſed in their perſecutions; and that was chiefely to perſecute their teachers, and what method they would for the future take, and that was, principally <hi>To kill and crucifie, the Prophets, Wiſemen, and Scribes,</hi> which Propheſie of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:158510:37"/>Chriſt, was here in this perſecution manifeſtly fulfilled: for here it is ſaid, They were all (<hi>viz.</hi> their teachers) ſcattered abroad and perſecuted, except the Apoſtles. It was I ſay ever the method and cuſtome of perſecutors to ayme principally at the rooting out and taking away of thoſe they ſuppoſed were ableſt to teach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the people, and this inraged them againſt <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt and Chriſt himſelf; and that made them at this time ſo miſchievouſly to perſecute their Miniſters and Teachers. Neither do I read in all the new Teſtament, before this perſecution, that as yet they were come to the maſſacreing of the common people; they had ſlain the Lord of Life, and ſtoned <hi>Stephen;</hi> and after in the 12. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read, <hi>How Herod ſlew Iames, and becauſe it pleaſed the Iews, he proceeded to take Peter:</hi> they alwayes had their eyes upon their teachers, and haled them to priſon, as they did <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> in the 4. of the <hi>Acts;</hi> but for the people the onely puniſhment they under-went, till this perſecution, was this, That they were caſt out of the Synagogues, if any of them did publickly profeſſe Chriſt. Indeed in this perſecution their violence extended to the haling of men and women to priſon; but before we read of no violence offered unto the people; onely they railed on them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viled, and reproached them, as all wicked men, whoſe tongues are ſet on fire from hell, uſe to do, on all the generation of the juſt. The ſame method did the Prelates here in <hi>England</hi> uſe; they chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and more principally perſecuted the faithfull and painfull Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers and Miniſters every where, and ſuch as they thought beſt able to inſtruct the people, and ſelected but here and there ſome private families for to ſcare others, and this method Antichriſt and his complices had learned from the devill and the Jews. So that when it is ſaid they were all ſcattered <hi>except the Apoſtles,</hi> it is to be underſtood that all their Preachers and Teachers, the Apoſtles only excepted, were ſcattered, For the word <hi>all</hi> in this place, muſt be underſtood, either of all the beleevers, or of all the Teachers and Officers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem, except the Apoſtles.</hi> But it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be underſtood of all the beleevers, that they were all ſcattered; and therefore it muſt be underſtood of all the Teachers, and that for many reaſons. The firſt, if all the beleevers had been ſcattered and none left, to what end then ſhould the twelve Apoſtles have remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>Ieruſalem?</hi> They were not to Preach to the wals, neither would they have remained there idle; but would rather have ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:158510:37"/>off the duſt off their feet, (as Chriſt commanded them) <hi>for a witneſſe against them, Luke</hi> 10. And would have departed and have gone away with the reſt of the Teachers, as all good reaſon perſwades. A ſecond reaſon is; becauſe if this particle <hi>all</hi> be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes exceptive, or taken to the utmoſt, and in the largeſt extent, as ſome of the brethren imply and would have it; then there ſhould not one beleever have been left in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> beſides the Apoſtles, which is expreſly againſt the Text, for <hi>verſ.</hi> 3. It is ſaid, <hi>That Saul brake into houſes, haling men and women, committing them to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> and this he did at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> at this time, as he acknowledgeth himſelfe <hi>Acts</hi> 26. <hi>ver.</hi> 10. And therefore of neceſſity it muſt follow, That all the beleevers were not ſcattered abroad, for ſome of them were in priſon in <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> And for ought I can gather, all the reſt were in their ſeverall houſes, or elſe the Apoſtles could have had no harbour: for if all their friends had been ſcattered by this tempeſt, and if all the ſheep had been drove away and the whole flock diſperſed, their Paſtors without doubt would have followed them: for he would be counted a very bad ſheep-heard that ſhould not follow or look after the poor ſheep that were ſcattered by the Wolves. Neither can we imagine that the Apoſtles that were the Paſtors of the flock of Jeſus Chriſt and to whoſe care he had committed his ſheep and his Lambs, with a ſpeciall charge that they ſhould feed them, would relinquiſh their care and chooſe rather to dwell amongſt a company of Wolves, from whom they could expect no fair meaſure, then among the ſheep: But in that all the Apoſtles ſtill remained in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> I rather gather, and that without all controverſie, they continued there for this very purpoſe, that they might comfort and ſupport the Church there, and refreſh the beleevers in this heat of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when they wanted the help of their other faithfull Miniſters and Paſtors. Thirdly, it is very evident from the Text, they were onely the Preachers that were ſcattered; for <hi>verſe</hi> 4. It is ſaid, <hi>That they that were ſcattered went every where preaching the Word,</hi> which expreſſion in the Originall, as may be proved by innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table places, ſignifieth ſuch teachers as were miniſters by Office, and ſuch as Preached by way of Sermons to a multitude, though they might likewiſe in private conference inſtruct, which their publike Miniſtery did not exempt them from. And although private Chriſtians may teach and inſtruct one another, as <hi>Aquilla</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:158510:38"/>and <hi>Priſcilla</hi> taught <hi>Apollos,</hi> and as all Chriſtians are commanded to inſtruct one another, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>ver.</hi> 16. Yet this text ſpeaks not of ſuch a teaching, but of preaching, <hi>They went every where,</hi> ſaith the Scripture <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>preaching the Word.</hi> For teaching may be an act of charity, but preaching is an act of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, <hi>for how can they preach except they be ſent? Rom.</hi> 10. So that by vertue of their Office, they might both publikely preach, and in private converſe alſo inſtruct others whereſoever they came, whether they were ſent out by perſecution or by miſſion. As I do conceive of any of thoſe Godly Miniſters, that were not many years ſince, drove from their habitations, and that were perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out of their places by the Prelates, that they might have preached publickely in any Congregration as Miniſters and men in Office, and might alſo have inſtructed privately, but the one was an act of duty as it was their Office, and the other of love and charity. And ſo may a well gifted private Chriſtian inſtruct and teach others upon occaſion, and in private conference, which is an act of love; but he cannot properly be ſaid to Preach, which is an act of one in Office and belongs onely to the Presbyters and Paſtors and ſuch, as for their ſufficient learning and abilities are called unto the Miniſtry and ordained and ſet a part to this Office: and ſuch onely were thoſe that were ſcattered, <hi>except the Apoſtles:</hi> and by all probability theſe Miniſters and Preachers that were ſcattered were thoſe that were at the chooſing of <hi>Matthias,</hi> the ſeventy Diſciples and many more. So that for ought I can gather, all the beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet remained in their ſeverall ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations and dwellings, except thoſe that were haled to priſon. And therefore of neceſſity there muſt be many Aſſemblies and Congregations yet in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> that made all the Apoſtles abide and continue ſtill among them all, which makes exceeding ſtrongly to prove, that there were innumerable multitudes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers ſtill in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> which of neceſſity were forced to divide their aſſemblies into more diſtributions and leſſe congregations then formerly, and therefore rather multiplyed their aſſemblies then otherwiſe, that by ſuch Privacy they might avoide perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as in our times, good Chriſtians here in <hi>London</hi> were wont to do, when the Prelates were in their ruff. But out of this place I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there were twelve of the moſt ableſt painfulleſt, and
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:158510:38"/>diligenteſt preachers in the world, and that gave themſelves conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually to prayer and the Miniſtery of the Word, and at ſuch a time, as there was moſt need of preaching, and when they could not pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely come together, by reaſon of the perſecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all Nations to be taught and preached unto in their ſeverall Languages and tongues; there of neceſſity there muſt be ſeverall Congregations and aſſemblies for the imployment of them all, both Preachers and hearers. But in the Church of Ieruſalem in the time of the hotteſt perſecution, there were the twelve Apoſtles, the moſt able, painfull, and diligent Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers in the world, and that gave themſelves continually to prayer and the Miniſtery of the Word, and when they could not publickly come together, by reaſon of the perſecution, and where there were innumerable multitudes of beleevers of all nations to be taught and preached unto in their ſeverall Languages and tongues. Therefore of neceſſity there muſt be ſeverall congregations and Aſſemblies for the imployment of them all, both Preachers and hearers.</hi> For this Syllogiſm, all and every part of it, is ſo cleered by what hath formerly been ſaid, as I am moſt aſſured, no rationall man will call either of the Propoſitions in queſtion. But from the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer place I thus further argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where there were ſuch multitudes of beleevers of all Nations and Countries, ſtill remaining even in the hotteſt time of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as had for many yeares imployed and continually taken up above an hundred painfull Ministers and Teachers, there they could not all meet together in any one place or room, but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſemblies, if they would all be edified, and much more now they were forced unto it, if they would avoyde perſecution, and provide for their own ſafety: But in the Church of Ieruſalem in the hotteſt time of perſecution, there were ſuch multitudes of beleevers of all nations and Countries ſtill remaining, as had for many years imployed and continually ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up above an hundred painfull miniſters and teachers:</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet together in any one place or room: but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into divers congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, if they would all be edified, and much more now were they forced unto it, if they would avoid perſecution and provide for their own ſafety.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="74" facs="tcp:158510:39"/>
            <p>The Major of this Syllogiſm by the very light of nature and reaſon, which we may not in a matter of diſputation eſpecially relinquiſh, is manifeſt and evident. For the Minor it is alſo apparent from the foregoing diſcourſe: by which it is proved, that their preachers onely were ſcattered, and all thoſe Miniſters that were at the chooſing the Apoſtle <hi>Matthias</hi> chap. 1. and many more that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the people: but for the people and beleevers they remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned ſtill in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the concluſion therefore is firme but I will now go on to evince that after the perſecution, there were more believers ſtill in the Church of Jeruſalem, then could all meet in any one place and room together: and therefore of neceſſity, they muſt be diſtributed into many Congregations and Aſſemblies. And for proof of this Aſſertion, the places following will ſuffice: and firſt that in the 9. chap. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> verſe 31. <hi>Then had the Churches rest through all Iuden, and Galilee and Samaria, and were all edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the holy Ghoſt, were multiplyed.</hi> Out of which words it may evidently appear, that perſecution is but the bellows of the Goſpell, and that which the enemies of the Goſpell think to be a means of extinguiſhing the light of it, makes it but more gloriouſly ſhine forth, and the farther to ſpread its rayes: for by blowing and puffing at it, they ſpread it the more, and extend it here and there farther abroad; as we ſee by this perſecution and ſcattering of thoſe Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpell: for this their diſperſion, by which the perſecuters had thought to have waſted the Churches, was an occaſion of the multiplication of them, and the cauſe of the increaſing of beleevers every where. And here we may alſo obſerve, That by how much more the rage of the enemy is great and violent, by ſo much it is leſſe dureable; for this great perſecution was but ſhort. And it cannot be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, but they who were ſcattered by perſecution, would upon the ceaſing of it, return again to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> as moſt people com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly do, to their own Countries, Cities, and places of habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on after perſecution. And this alſo muſt needs be a great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to induce others to the love of that Religion, which they ſee God ſo much favoureth the lovers and prefeſſors of; the which the Lord ſo preſerveth, comforteth, and followeth, with ſo many mercies, and upholdeth in all their afflictions and tryalls never
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:158510:39"/>forſaking, nor never leaving them. But if thoſe that were ſcattered had never returned, that maketh nothing for the weaking the truth of this Propoſition, that there were many Congregations and Aſſemblies ſtill in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for this Text proveth that it was not decreaſed after the diſperſion. Out of the which words I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Church before the perſecution and disperſion of whoſe Miniſters and Paſtors, was ſo numerous and had ſuch multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of beleevers in it, of all Nations, as they could not all meet in any one place or room, for edification, and to partake in all asts of worſhip, but were forced to preach in divers and ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry places, as in the Temple and from houſe to houſe; and after the perſecution ceaſed and the Church had rest, was greatlier yet multiplyed than before; and whoſe companies were more and more in number increaſed, they of neceſſity could not all meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in any one place or room for edification, and to partake in all acts of worſhip, but muſt neceſſarily be diſtributed into divers and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies if they would all be edified. But the Church of Ieruſalem, before the perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution and disperſion of her Miniſters and Paſtors, was ſo nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous and had ſuch multitudes of beleevers in it of all nations, as they could not all meet in any one place or room for edification, and to partake in all acts of worſhip; but were forced to preach indivers and ſundry places, as in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe; and after the perſecution ceaſed and the Churches had reſt, was greatlier yet multiplyed than before: and whoſe companies were more and more in number increaſed.</hi> Ergo, <hi>Of neceſſity af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the perſecution there were more beleevers in the Church of Ieruſalem, then could all meet together in any one place or room for edification, and to partake in all acts of worſhip, but must neceſſarily be diſtributed into divers Congregations and Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies if they would be edified.</hi> For the Major beſides com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon underſtanding and ordinary reaſon which confirm it, it is manfeſt from the 2.3. and 5. <hi>Chapters</hi> of the <hi>Acts,</hi> which in expreſſe words ſignifieth, That they met dayly in the Temple and from houſe to houſe, yea in every houſe, and therefore that is true and out of all doubt: and for the Minor it is evident from the place above cited, where it is ſaid, The
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:158510:40"/>Churches, (that is to ſay, all the Churches in <hi>Judea,</hi> of which <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was the mother Church) <hi>were multiplyed,</hi> the word in the Originall <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> ſignifieth properly an increaſe in number and multitude and not in meaſure; and is ſo to be underſtood in this place, and cannot being applyed unto perſons, be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe taken, whatſoever it may of ſinnes and graces; and then alſo the word is capable of this conſtruction, as may be proved if need required: So that the concluſion doth follow. And truely that of Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Galatians</hi> is an excellent Argument to evince there were more Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then one, where proving that he had not received the Goſpell which he preached from men, but from God, he uſeth this reaſon; That if he had received it from men, it muſt be from the <hi>Iews,</hi> and from the Apoſtles; for the Gentiles were ignorant of it, and he was to carry the Goſpell unto them, and therefore they could not teach it him; and to prove that he received it not from the Apoſtles, he thus ſpeaketh of himſelf.</p>

               <hi>When it pleaſed God to reveal his ſon unto me, that I might preach him amongſt the Heathen, Immediately I conferred not with fleſh and blood, neither went I up to Ieruſalem, to them that were Apoſtles before me, but I went into Arabia. Then after three yeares I went up to Ieruſalem, to ſee Peter, and aboade with him fifteen dayes, but other of the Apoſtles ſaw I none, ſave Iames the Lords brother.</hi>

            <p>Out of the which words beſides the ſingular teſtimony we have that the preaching and writings of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> are the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of <hi>Ieſus Chriſt,</hi> and the Word of the <hi>living God,</hi> againſt the Papiſts: we may evidently gather againſt the Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, that after the perſecution there were more believers in Jeruſalem then either did or could all meet in one place; for in ſaying that he was with <hi>Peter</hi> fifteen dayes, but in all that time ſaw none of the Apoſtles ſave <hi>Iames,</hi> this I ſay, is a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient Argument to prove more Congregations and aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of beleevers in the Church of Jeruſalem, which ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Apoſtles in their ſeverall miniſteries as they had not ſo much ſpare time to viſit <hi>Paul,</hi> and that <hi>Paul</hi> alſo was ſo taken up in preaching there, that he had no leiſure to viſit
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:158510:40"/>them. And for the diligence of the Apoſtles in their Miniſtry it is ſaid in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts, That they gave themſelves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually to prayer and to the Miniſtery of the Word:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they were never idle; and that the Apoſtles either all or the moſt of them continued reſident for many years in Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, before they diſtributed themſelves into ſeverall Nations and Countries; and that very few of them were ſent abroad there are frequent teſtimonies in <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles; neither as yet did I ever hear it ſcrupled, or call'd in queſtion, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Apoſtles were then there or no, when <hi>Paul</hi> was at Jeruſalem, for it is taken <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that either all or the moſt of them were at that time in <hi>Ieruſalem:</hi> neither doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, I ſaw none of the other Apoſtles becauſe they were abſent, or were gone to Preach the Goſpell in other places. And for Saint <hi>Paul</hi> we read, that whereſoever he came, he went into their Synagogues and into their Aſſemblies to Preach, and that he preacht from houſe to houſe: and he that gave ſo ſtrict a charge to <hi>Timothy</hi> (and in him to all Miniſters) that he ſhould Preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; he himſelf without all doubt, would not neglect his duty, who in the 20. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> ſets his own example before all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters for their imitation in their diligent preaching, and he ordinarily preached by the day and by the night, as is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt out of the ſame Chapter and many other places; and ſurely the time he remained with <hi>Peter</hi> in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> he was as diligent in Preaching, as he was in any of the other Churches; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth of himſelf that the care of all the Churches lay upon him, and that he laboured more then all the other Apoſtles in their particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars: ſo that it ſtandeth with all reaſon, that while he was in <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> he was very ſedulous in Preaching, as who had both ſtrength of body, and Gods ſpeciall aſſiſtance, and his immediate inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration alwayes to help him in his Miniſtery; ſo that I conceive, as of charity I am bound, that <hi>Paul</hi> was dayly in one aſſembly or other: now if there had been at that time, no more belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> then could have met in one place, congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Aſſembly, then of neceſſity <hi>Paul</hi> muſt have ſeen the other Apoſtles there, as well as <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Iames</hi> (for they alſo were good Church-men, to ſpeak a little in the Prelates
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:158510:41"/>dialect) and they never left the Word, but were alwayes taken up either in praying or preaching amongſt them in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, yea in every houſe: and if there had been but one Congregation or Aſſembly of beleevers in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> the Apoſtles would dayly upon all occaſions have been with their flock: Now in that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaw them not in all that time he was in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> it is evidently apparent there were more Congregations of beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> then one, and more Chriſtians then could all meet in any one or a few places.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to a place or two more for the further confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of this truth <hi>Acts</hi> 12. verſe 24. It is ſaid there, <hi>that the word of God grew and multiplyed.</hi> Here alſo we have another good effect of a new fierce perſecution in Jeruſalem; it increaſed the number and multitude of Believers there after the Perſecutor was taken away, <hi>For the Word of God grew and multiplyed,</hi> ſaith the Holy Ghoſt. Out of which words I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Where the Word of God daily more and more grew and multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after the perſecution, that is to ſay, where there were more mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church, through the Ministery and preaching of the Goſpell then was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; which notwithſtanding was then ſo numerous, as they could not all meet in any one place or roome, to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification, there of neceſſity they muſt be diſtributed into diverſe aſſemblies and congregations, to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification. But in the Church of Jeruſalem after a double perſecution, the Word of God daily more and more grew and multiplyed; that is to ſay, there were more multitudes and greater numbers of Believers added unto the Church through the miniſtery and preaching of the Goſpell by the Apoſtles then was before; which notwithſtanding was then ſo numerous, as they could not all poſſibly meet in any one place and roome.</hi> Ergo, <hi>there was a greater number of Believers after the Perſecution then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: and therefore of neceſſity they could not all meet in any one place or roome to communicate in all the Ordinances, but must be diſtributed into ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies if they would all be edified.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the Major I conceive it is ſo evidently clear as no man
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:158510:41"/>of ordinary underſtanding will not ſee the truth of it. For the Minor, the Text proveth it: and if we will compare Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with Scripture, the truth of it will by and by be out of controverſie, for in the 15 of <hi>John</hi> verſe 16. Our Saviour ſpeaking there to his Diſciples, ſaith, <hi>I have choſen you and ordained you that you ſhould go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit ſhould remaine:</hi> that is, I have choſe you to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell and convert men, which is the fruit of preaching the Word; and cauſeth the multiplycation of Believers, for Faith commeth by hearing, <hi>Romans</hi> 10. Now this Scripture is here fulfilled, for it is ſaid, that the Word of God grew and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplyed; that is, it brought forth the great fruit and increaſe of multitudes of Believers, and converted many, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the perſecutions that were raiſed againſt it and the Church. So that the concluſion muſt neceſſarily follow from the premiſes, and it is moſt apparent, that there were many congregations of Believers in Jeruſalem after the Perſecution. But in the 21 Chapter, 20 Verſe, there is a place that putteth an end to this Controverſie; and with the which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude my firſt aſſertion. In theſe words, <hi>Thou ſeeſt Brother</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>James,</hi> and the Presbyters of Jeruſalem to Saint <hi>Paul) how many ten thouſands</hi> (for ſo it is in the Originall, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>of Jewes there are which believe, and they are all zealous of the law:</hi> In this place the Evangeliſt ſpeakes of the Inhabitants of Ieruſalem that were Believers, and had their abode there, and not of ſtrangers, as our Brethren ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſuch as they conceive were come up to Jeruſalem at that time to the feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> at which they thinke <hi>Paul</hi> then was: which opinion of theirs might be confuted with many reaſons, if it were neceſſary; ſome of the which I ſhall briefly ſet down: as firſt, it is well knowne that the feaſt of Pentecoſt laſted but one day, and that in the time of Wheat-harveſt, when ordinarily but few came to Jeruſalem. Beſides none of the Jewes that lived out of the Countrey of Judea, and the confines of Iſrael, were injoyned to come to that feaſt, or any other of the feaſts ſo farre as I remember; neither indeed could they, dwelling in ſuch remote countries; except they ſpent all their time in running about. So that as
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:158510:42"/>I conceive it was arbitrary in the Jewes, that dwelt in other countries, whether they would come or no to all thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Feaſts: though I have this opinion of ſome of the moſt zealous of them, and beſt ableſt and richeſt of them, and that had time and leaſure, that they would ſpare neither paines nor coſts, ſo they might enjoy the Ordinances and the ſociety of their Brethren. Beſides we reade but of very few ſtrangers, that were at Jeruſalem at this time when <hi>Paul</hi> was there, and they were them of <hi>Aſia,</hi> which were perſecutors rather then believers, as the ſtory relateth, verſe 27, 28. Now the multitude of which there is mention made in this place in the 22 verſe, they were all Believers, and were inhabitants, and ſuch as were well knowne to Saint <hi>James</hi> and the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and were all ſtrangers to <hi>Paul;</hi> and ſuch as had onely heard that <hi>Paul taught all the Jewes that were among the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles to forſake Moſes, &amp;c.</hi> And therefore none of theſe many ten thouſands were of the believing <hi>Iewes amongſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> for they are clearly diſtinguiſhed from them: for it is ſaid, that thoſe Myriads of believing <hi>Iewes were informed that Paul taught all the Iewes among the Gentiles, &amp;c.</hi> They then were informed that <hi>Paul</hi> had taught others. The Jewes among the Gentiles were they who <hi>Paul</hi> had ſo taught, and how could they be in the number of them that were informed? Had they need to bee informed by others what St. <hi>Paul</hi> had taught themſelves? Therefore they muſt needs be the belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Jewes of Jeruſalem, and the inhabitants and dwellers there. So that out of the Text I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Many ten thouſands of Believers could not all meet at any one time, or in any one place or congregation to enjoy all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to edification; but of neceſſity muſt be diſtributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, if they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in all acts of worſhip and be edified. But in the Church of Jeruſalem after all the perſecutions, there were many ten thouſands believers.</hi> Ergo, <hi>they could not all meet together at any one time, or in any one place or congregation, for the enjoying of all acts of worſhip to edification; but of neceſſity muſt be distributed into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and ſundry congregations and aſſemblies, if they would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take in all the Ordinances, and be edified.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="81" facs="tcp:158510:42"/>
            <p>For the major all reaſon will aſſent unto it; for the minor, the text it ſelf confirms it, neither doth that word <hi>ever</hi> expreſſe leſſe then tenne thouſand as might out of many places of Scripture be proved and divers Authors. And truly to any man but of an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary underſtanding it would ſeeme ſtrange, yea, an incredible thing, that <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the theater of ſo many miracles, and where there were twelue Apoſtles, and the moſt of them for the moſt part reſident, and ſo many famous Preachers and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and who at the firſt beginning of the Miniſtry, after they had received the guift of the Holy Ghoſt, by their powerfull preaching, and a few miracles, had in a ſhort time converted about eight thouſand people, beſides great multitudes both of men and women, beſides Prieſts, and who preached daily in the Temple, and from houſe to houſe, and that for above twenty years together, (as moſt of the Apoſtles did without interruption) that in all this time of the Goſpels ſpring, and that in ſo popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and numerous a City, that all theſe famous Miniſters ſhould convert no more to the faith, then might all meet in one Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation. I ſay, all this will ſeeme ſtrange to any rationall man, and as it is againſt all reaſon, ſo it is againſt the expreſſe Word of the holy Scriptures, as hath out of many places in the foregoing diſcourſe been ſufficiently made appeare, and out of the place laſt cited; which doth affirm that there were many ten thouſands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> after all the perſecutions; all which could not meet in any one place to injoy all acts of worſhip, no not in a few: Whether therefore, it hath not by this and the many other teſtimonies of holy Scripture, and the arguments out of both, been ſufficiently proved, that there were many Congregations in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I report my ſelfe to any that have not the pearl of prejudice in the eye of their judgement? and this ſhall ſuffiſe to have ſpoke for the proofe of my firſt aſſertion.</p>
            <p>The ſecond now followes, <hi>viz. That all theſe Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies made but one Church.</hi> And for proofe of this I ſhall not need to uſe many words, or any great diſpute; for the brethren themſelves acknowledge that all the beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> were all members of that Church; and they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord further, that it was but one Church. and it is manifeſt out of the holy Scripture, for it is ſaid, they that were converted
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:158510:43"/>were added to the Church, and therefore members of it, and that they continued in the Churches communion, and in the Apoſtles doctrine and put their eſtates in the Churches common treaſury, and choſe Officers for the Church; all this I ſay our brethren do acknowledge, and take this fellowſhip of theſe mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers for a patterne of ordinary Church communion, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this my ſecond aſſertion is without controverſie, it being in expreſſe words ſet downe in the 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Chapters of the <hi>Acts,</hi> and many more places of the ſame ſtory, and conſented to by the Brethren.</p>
            <p>I now come to prove my third aſſertion. <hi>viz. That the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Presbyters governed, ordered, and ruled this Church, conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, by a Common-councell and Presbytery.</hi> Which is alſo evident by the places fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>And in thoſe daies there came Prophets from Jeruſalem to Antioch, and there ſtood up one of them named Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus, and ſignified by the Spirit, that there ſhould be great dearth through all the world, which came to paſſe in the daies of Claudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us Caeſar; then the Diſciples every man according to his ability, determined to ſend reliefe unto the brethren that dwelt in Judea, which alſo they did, and ſent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.</hi> Here in theſe laſt words we ſee that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, and none but the Presbyters received the almes, for it is ſaid, <hi>they ſent it to the Presbyters by the hands of Barnabas and Saul,</hi> which ſufficiently proveth that the Presbyters in all Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches were the men in government, as who had the ordering and authority of appointing unto the Deacons, how they ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute thoſe moneys, that they might be beſt improved and diſpoſed of, which is an act of government, as all men (that know what belongs unto government) will acknowledge. Now, ſhould it be granted that theſe Presbyters here ſpoken of, were the Presbyters of <hi>Judea,</hi> which notwithſtanding is not ſpecified, but <hi>only the diſtreſſed brethren in Judea,</hi> yet had it been in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe words ſet down, that the almes had been ſent to the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bytery of <hi>Judea,</hi> the Presbytery of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt neceſſarily have been included in it, as being the Metropolis of <hi>Judea;</hi> and it was an ordinary thing for the Churches abroad, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly that of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to ſend to the Apoſtles and Presbyters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as we may ſee <hi>Act.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 22. and <hi>Act.</hi> 15. And by
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:158510:43"/>all probability <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> brought theſe almes to the Presbyters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> for he in the fifteenth Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> maketh mention of a contribution that was made in <hi>Macedonia</hi> and <hi>Achaia</hi> for the poore Saints in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> whether the Apoſtle, ſaies he, was going to miniſter unto them and deſireth the <hi>Romans</hi> to pray for him, that he may be delivered from the unbeleeving <hi>Jewes,</hi> and that his ſervice for <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> might be accepted of the Saints, which by the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Interpreters is generally taken that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaketh of this time, and that they were then ſent from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> to <hi>Antioch.</hi> But howſoever, it ſhould be underſtood, that theſe almes were ſent to the Presbyters in <hi>Judea,</hi> yet theſe two concluſions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily reſult from it. The firſt, that this expreſſion comprehends alſo the Presbyters of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as being the chiefe City of <hi>Iudea.</hi> The ſecond, that the Presbyters in all Churches were the men to whom the government and ordering of buſineſſes was committed, and in whoſe hands the power and authority lay of diſpoſing of the very charity and bounty of the brethren to all the neceſſitated Diſciples within their juriſdictions, and who gave directions to the Deacons how they ſhould be diſtributed to the beſt emolument and benefit of the poore, and according to the intention of theſe benefactors, which, as it is an act of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and that a principall one, ſo of neceſſity the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters muſt then meet together, that by their joint and common conſent and counſell, all things may be rightly ordered.</p>
            <p>But in the <hi>chap.</hi> 15. <hi>v.</hi> 2.4.6.22. the Presbyters of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> by name are expreſſed, and in <hi>chap.</hi> 16. and in <hi>Act.</hi> 21. <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. in theſe words. <hi>Then they determined that Paul and Barnabas and certaine other of them ſhould go up to Ieruſalem unto the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Presbyters, about this queſtion and they were received of the Church, and of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, to whom they decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red all things that God had done with them, and how that there roſe up certaine of the Sect of the Phariſes which believed, ſaying, that it was needfull to circumcize them, and to command them to keep the law of Moſes, and the Apoſtles and Presbyters; came together to conſider of this matter, &amp;c.</hi> ver. 22. <hi>Then pleaſed it the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles and Presbyters with the whole Church, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>And as they went through the Cities they delivered them the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees to keep, that were ordained of the Apoſtles and Presbyters which were at Ieruſalem, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>chap.</hi> 21, <hi>v.</hi> 17, 18. <hi>And when we
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:158510:44"/>were come to Ieruſalem, the Brethren received us gladly, and the day following Paul went in with us unto Iames, and all the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters were preſent,</hi> and <hi>v.</hi> 25. <hi>As touching the Gentiles which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, we have written and concluded, ſay the Presbyters, that they obſerve no ſuch thing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of all which places, before I frame my arguments to prove that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> conſiſting of many Congregations and aſſemblies was governed by a Presbytery, that is, by the joint conſent &amp; common councell of the Apoſtles &amp; Presbyters, which made but a grand Presbytery: I ſhall deſire all men to conſider, that howſoever the Apoſtles in the places above ſpecified, are differenced by that title from the Presbyters, yet in all acts of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment performed by them in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> they were for the ſubſtance of them ordinary acts, ſuch as Presbyters daily performe, and therfore anſwerably the Apoſtles themſelves are in them to be conſidered as presbyters, that is, men governing in an ordinary way, as ſuch as had received the keys, which is the power of juriſdiction, &amp; therefore were in their ordinary imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though at other times in their ſeverall miniſtries, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from Nation to Nation to preach, as Chriſts extraordinary Ambaſſadours, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. they uſed ſuperlative authority, and I am induced ſo to believe as having received authority, becauſe the Aopſtles in holy Scripture are called Presbyters, that was the ordinary Governours and Magiſtrates of the Church, though the more principall and primary ones, and therefore did act as Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters in ordinary acts of Church government, and for a pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern to all Churches in like adminiſtration: Neither may any ſuppoſe, for all this, that the Apoſtles did fall lower in their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in that they acted as Presbyters; for our Brethren do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that at <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> the Apoſtles acted as Presbyters of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Congregation; Now then if they did not fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a particular congregation, what reaſon will dictate to any man, that they ſhould fall lower in their power by acting as Presbyters in a joint Presbytery? The truth is, to govern and to rule the Church was the ordinary imployment of the Apoſtles, and therefore they are ſtiled Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, which is to ſay, the Rulers, Councellors, Magiſtrates, and Governours of the Church; neither, for all this, did their Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterſhips exclude their Apoſtleſhips, nor did their acting as Presbyters, deprive them of their Apoſtolique power, nor of
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:158510:44"/>that apoſtolique ſpirit which guided them, even in theſe things wherein they acted as Presbyters, for although under one noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on we looke upon the Apoſtles as extraordinary men, yet under another, as in all thoſe affaires of publique concernment, and in matter of government, and for that end the aſſembling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together; we do not conſider them as Apoſtles, for therein they did not act as Apoſtles, with a tranſcendent and infallible authority, and in an extraordinary way, but as Presbyters, and ordinary Governours and Counſellors and in ſuch a way, as makes their meetings and actions a patterne and preſident to ſucceding ages, and of the Prerbyters congregating of themſelves together for common acts of Government, whether in a Presbyterian or Synodicall way. And as it is in civill affaires, and in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Kingdomes and States, ſo it was then in the Church of God; in a Kingdome ſome of the Counſellors are of the more ſecret admiſſion, and are generally called Cabbinet Counſellors, and are accounted of as extraordinary men, and others of the generall Councell; yet when all theſe ſit in a common councell together, to conſult about matters of State and publique con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, they ſit then together as ordinary Counſellors, and every one of them has as much authority and liberty to debate things by reaſon and diſpute in way of conſultation, and to give his vote about any thing as well as any of the moſt extraordinary Counſellors, and this hath been the practiſe of all ages. We read that <hi>Huſhy</hi> when he was by <hi>Abſalon</hi> called into councell, had his voice and gave his vote as well as <hi>Achitophel</hi> the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of that time; and as in the Common-Councels and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Kingdomes, whatſoever honour, dignity, or extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary imployments any of them were taken up in before their ſeſſion and meeting, or whatſoever dignity or titles of honour they have extraordinarily above others, and take their places ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly before they come together into the Parliament, yet they all ſitting there as Judges and Peeres in the Kingdome, the meaneſt Lord in the Kingdome hath as much authourity there as the greateſt, and ſo in the Houſe of Commons: as they are Judges, and choſen by the people for that purpoſe, have all of them, even the meaneſt, as much voice and authority in way of conſultation as the greateſt: And ſo likewiſe in the Synod or
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:158510:45"/>Aſſembly now of Divines, the meaneſt Presbyter hath as much voice and liberty in way of debate and voting, as the greateſt Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop there. And even ſo it was in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Apoſtles thoſe extraordinary gifted men, and presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together in counſell, they all acted there as counſellors and ordinary presbyters; and therefore in all thoſe particular actions of the Apoſtles, we have mention of in their ſeverall meetings, whether we conſider them by themſelves alone, and not joyned with the presbyters, or in common councell with them, thoſe actions, I ſay, were done and acted by men which were Apoſtles, but not as they were Apoſtles excluſively, ſo as they might not act them under another notion, neither will our Brethren affirme it; for if the Apoſtles did preach, take the truſt of the goods of the Church, ordaine Officers, as Apoſtles exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively and in an extraordinary way, and as by a priviledge peculiar to themſelves, it would follow from thence, that none may doe any of thoſe things but Apoſtles, which the Brethren will not aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unto: as for ſome inſtances, In that ordination of Deacons in the ſixth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> the Apoſtles there acted partly as Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and partly as presbyters, for in conſtituting an office in the Church, which was not before, they acted their apoſtolicall au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, but in ordaining men to that office which the Church had choſen, they did act as presbyters: and there is no doubt but the Brethren will yeeld to this, for if they will not grant that the Apoſtles did herein act partly as Apoſtles, and partly as preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, they muſt then accord, that they acted either onely as presbyters, or onely as Apoſtles: If onely as presbyters, thence it will follow, that all presbyters have power, not onely to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine men, but to erect a new office in the Church: If onely as Apoſtles, then hence is no warrant for presbyters, ſo much as to ordaine men into any office, nor for ſo much as to meet together to conſult about acts of government, either in a presbyterian or in a Synodicall way: and by this meanes all Church-government would ſpeedily be overthrowne. Neither is it a difficult thing in our Brethren or any other man to diſtinguiſh between theſe two; for looke by what infallible rule they make ſome thing in the practiſe of the Apoſtles, to be not onely a patterne and preſident for imitation, but even a proofe of inſtitution, yet decline other things practiſed by the ſame Apoſtles as things not only by inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution,
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:158510:45"/>not commanded to us, but not permitted to be imitated by us: By the ſame rule, they may infallibly diſtinguiſh between what they acted as Apoſtles, and what they acted as Presbyters and as ordinary Counſellors, Judges and Governours, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all they may infer and conclude, that what they acted as Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and by joint and common conſent, it was to give a patterne and preſident to all Presbyters and Synods in all ſucceeding ages; and as the taking in of the conſent of the Church in the choice of Deacons, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. was to give a patterne for the ſufferage and voice of the people in all Churches to the end of the world, in choſing of their Deacons; ſo for another inſtance, as there were many congregations in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and divers aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and all theſe congregations made but one Church, and the Apoſtles and Presbyters who were officers governed that jointly and by a common councell, (as our Brethren acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:) Here likewiſe they left a patterne and preſident to all ages, for ſeverall congregations and aſſemblies in a City, or vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity to unite into one Church; and for the Officers and Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of theſe congregations to governe that Church jointly in a Colledge and Presbytery. And for a third inſtance, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Presbyters met together in a Synodicall way, and the Apoſtles in that aſſembly acted not by an apoſtollicall and infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, no more then the Presbyters did, (as when they were writing of Scripture) but ſtating the queſtion, and debating it from Scripture in an ordinary way, (as it is at large diſcuſſed in <hi>Act.</hi> 15. (which we never reade they did when they writ the Scripture,) and having by diſputing, arguing and ſearching the Scripture, found what was <hi>the good and acceptable will of God;</hi> thereupon they determined the queſtion, ſaying, <hi>it ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and us,</hi> as the aſſembly now of Divines, or any other, for ought I know, upon like aſſurance of Scripture war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, may doe. In this action alſo, and their ſo doing, the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Presbyters left an example and preſident to all the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of all ſucceeding ages, what they ſhould doe upon the like occaſions, for the deciding of controverſies and differences of opinions in Religion. <hi>viz.</hi> To congregate and meet together in ſome one place, to ſtate the queſtions, and to debate them from Scripture, and to follow the written Word, as their rule in all things, and whatſoever they doe, to do it by joint conſent, and
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:158510:46"/>the common councell of them all, or by the moſt voices, but in all this their proceedings they muſt ever cleave to the rule of the Word of God, or warrantable authority and evidence of reaſon deduced from thence, as then the apoſtles and presbyters did; yea, the very name of the Presbyters in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſignifieth the Judges, Counſellors, Magiſtrates and Rulers of that Church, who had the keyes committed unto them as well as the apoſtles; and by their place were more peculiarly overſeers of that Church, as they were tyed unto it, then the apoſtles; as the Presbyters of <hi>Epheſus</hi> were in that Church, and were aſſigned in their ſeverall places to execute their office, and to looke to their particular charges in the government; ſo that whether the apoſtles were preſent or abſent, the presbyters had the government laid upon their ſhoulders; and if the apoſtles themſelves had taught con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this conſtitution, or an angell from Heaven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. I am confident the Presbyters would not have obeyed them, nor have relinquiſhed their authority, neither ought they, but would ſtill have kept that rule, power and authority, which God had put in their hands; ſo that for my owne particular, I looke upon the apoſtles in all theſe ſeverall actions, and in all thoſe acts of government, joyned and met together with the Presbyters, as I looke upon Counſellors and Judges in the great councels of Kingdoms, where all the judges have equall power &amp; authority in deciſive voting, and I do verily believe, that the Presbyters ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at any time in councell with any one or more of the apoſtles, did act as authoritatively as the apoſtles themſelves &amp; I am ever able to prove it and make it good againſt any man, that the Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters might as wel conclude, It ſeemed good to the Holy Ghoſt and to us, as well as the apoſtles, and may ſay, we have written and concluded, as well as the apoſtles; as any two or three of the Parliament, whether of the Lords or Commons, may as well ſay, we have made ſuch an Ordinance, as any twenty of them, or the whole councell, and that without diſparagement or impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dignity of any, when they joyned with them in that worke, and aſſented to it; and in this very notion I looke up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the presbyters in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> joyned with the apoſtles and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them as in my contemplations I looke upon the Lords and Commons now ſitting in the great Councell, as the grand civill presbytry of the Kingdome, where all binding Ordinances are
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:158510:46"/>to be paſſed by the joynt conſent and Common-counſel of them all, and whoſe place and office it is to command and rule, and the peoples office and place to obey and yeeld ſubjection to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they command and injoyne, according to the will of God and for the common good and preſervation of themſelves and the whole Kingdome; and that whoſoever ſhould reſiſt this their juſt authority are guilty of contumacy and are high offendors and delinquents; for God hath layed the government upon them, and left the duty of obedience to the ſubjects who may not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a publicke cale intermeddle with matters of government.</p>
            <p>And ſo in the matters of Church government, I looke upon Presbyters as Gods peculiar ſervants, and as upon the Stewards, Councellours and Magiſtrates and Judges in the Church as men ſet apart by God himſelfe for this purpoſe to be the teachers and rulers of their flocks committed unto them in the Lord; to whom in the matters of their ſoules all people under their ſeverall Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters ſo farre as they command in the Lord, and according to the written word, are to yeeld obedience, and much to reverence and honour them, and this according to Gods command, for it is his ordinance. And they are not to be looked on and ſlited as the fagge ends of the Cleargy, as many black mouthes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane lips ſpeake of them: for the Presbyters, they have their authority as well grounded in the word of God, as Kings and States have theirs; and therefore as they are imployed in a more ſupreame orbe, and in matters of eternall concernment, ſo they ſhould be venerated as men watching over our ſoules, and all contumelious ſpeeches againſt them deſerve ſevere puniſhment and ought not to be tolerated: and ſo much the more the Presbyters of this Kingdome in theſe our dayes, have deſerved better from the Church, the Parliament and the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome then any of their predeceſſors, not onely in deſiring a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and through Reformation in both Doctrine and Diſcipline, but in that they have ſtood now ſo cordially to the comon cauſe, and more for the liberty of the Subject then any before them, and have cleaved moſt faithfully to the Parliament &amp; have bin al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo a moſt ſingular means of keeping the people wherſoever they were ſuffered to Preach, in obedience. In all theſe reſpects. I ſay, they deſerve well, yea better, not onely from the Church but from all the Kingdome for the preſent, than any of their prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſours,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:158510:47"/>and their memories ought to be famous to all poſterity for this their good ſervice. And that government that God has given unto the Presbyters, if the Lords and Commons ſhall now labour to eſtabliſh it in the Kingdome, and to ſettle it on them, they may not onely promiſe unto themſelves a bleſſing from heaven, and peace unto the Church and State, but alſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortall praiſe from all ſucceeding ages. Having taken leave to make this digreſſion, I will now to my buſineſſe, and prove that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> conſiſting of many Congregations and Aſſemblies, were all governed by a common Presbytery: and that the Apoſtles there acted as Presbyters among the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters.</p>
            <p>They that <hi>in the holy Scripture are called Presbyters, and acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common counſell, with the Presbyters, and exerciſed that ordinary power that was committed to them in the</hi> 18. <hi>of Matthew, they acted as Presbyters:</hi> but the Apoſtles in governing the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem conſiſting of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Congregations and Aſſemblies, acted and ordered things in a joynt body and common councell with the Presbytery of that Church as Presbyters,</hi> Ergo, <hi>the Church of Ieruſalem was Presbytrianly governed, and by a common counſell of Presbyters.</hi> The major and minor of this Syllogyſme being proved, the concluſion will neceſſarily inſue. And for proofe of the major the Scripture is cleere, as 1 Tim. cha. 4. ver. 14, where <hi>Paul</hi> writing unto <hi>Timothy</hi> ſaith, <hi>neglect not the gift that is in thee, which was given thee to preach, with the laying on of the hands of the presbytery:</hi> in the which Presbytery <hi>Paul</hi> was one that laid his hands on him and ordained him, as is evident in the ſecond Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> chap the firſt, verſe the ſixt, where putting <hi>Timothy</hi> in minde of his duty, he ſaith <hi>ſtirre up the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands:</hi> ſo that <hi>Paul</hi> joyning in this publicke action of ordination, though an Apoſtle, yet acted as a Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and counts himſelfe in the number of them, as any of the Presbyters that now ordaine the Miniſters, may ſay as well as all of them together, to any new ordained Miniſter, <hi>neglect not the gift of God which is in thee, by the putting on of my hands.</hi> As men ordinarily in a Jury, may aſſume that unto themſelves that all may doe, as being actors in common. So <hi>Peter</hi> likewiſe in his firſt Epiſtle, chap. 5. ver. 1, 2. cals himſelfe a fellow presbyter, and
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:158510:47"/>Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in his ſecond and third Epiſtles ſtiles him ſo alſo, <hi>The presbyter unto the elect Lady, &amp;c. The presbyter unto the well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Gajus, &amp;c.</hi> So that his presbyterſhip did not exclude his apoſtleſhip, nor the acting at any time of a presbyter, deprive him of his apoſtolicall power, for at that very time he cals himſelfe a presbyter, he wrote Scripture by an apoſtolicall and infallible ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and yet continued ſtill a presbyter. Sothat for the major, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I ſhould ſay no more it is ſufficiently proved; yet for a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther corroboration of it, it is not good to reject the conſent of our Brethren in this point, for they acknowledge, that the apoſtles are called presbyters vertually, becauſe, as they ſay, <hi>apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip contained all offices in it;</hi> yea, they further aſſert, <hi>the act of miniſteriall power to be the ſame in the Apoſtles and Presbyters,</hi> the onely difference they ſeeme to inſinuate, is, <hi>in the extent;</hi> from which it may be inferred, that in all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faires tranſacted by the apoſtles, properly concerning the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> they did act as presbyters, becauſe in ſuch acts there was no extent of their power to many much leſſe to all Churches. But when they affirme, that the apoſtles power over many congregations, was founded upon their power over all churches, and ſo cannot be a patterne and preſident for the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of presbyters over many.</p>
            <p>For anſwer, firſt I ſay, that the Brethren, in my opinion, take more upon them then beſeemeth them, and uſurpe a kinde of unlimited authority to themſelves that they can make what plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them exemplary, only, &amp; reject whatſoever agreeth not with their opinion, though they were all the acts of all the apoſtles, and tranſacted by joint conſent, and common agreement and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, and left in the Church of Chriſt, as well for a patterne and preſident for the Presbyters and Miniſters to follow in all ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding ages to the end of the world, as any of their other acts; &amp; ſo they pick &amp; chooſe at pleaſure, and in ſo doing (under reformation be it ſpoke) I ſay they aſſume unto themſelves a greater authority then beſeemes them, for they can make the apoſtles joynt, go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governing of one congregation, (for ſo they take it <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> that the church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was but one congregation,) to be a patterne of many miniſters governing one congregation; but whereas it is moſt evident, that the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of many congregations, and were yet under but one presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:158510:48"/>and was governed by the joint conſent of the Apoſtles and Presbyters, as under a grand common presbytry, this at pleaſure they teject and make it no way exemplary and binding. But for a further anſwer I aſſert, that the apoſtles power and authority over many aſſemblies as one Church, to rule and governe them all as one church, jointly and in common, was not grounded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their power over all churches, but upon the union of thoſe aſſemblies and congregations into one church, which union lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a foundation for the power of presbyters ruling and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many congregations; and the apoſtles practice in governing many aſſemblies jointly as one church, is the pattern and example of that government to all ſucceeding ages; &amp; this preſident of the Apoſtles, the presbyters in all churches ought to ſet before their eyes in all reformation, for what the apoſtles did in the publike affaires of government, they did as presbyters, and for imitation. Neither do our Brethren onely grant the act of miniſterial pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to be the ſame in the apoſtles and presbyters, ſaving in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: but they acknowledg alſo, that they were called presbyters vertually as I ſaid before; &amp; that the apoſtles acted in a joint body and by common conſent &amp; affirme that it was fit that they ſhould ſo do, and ſay withall, that the apoſtles wherever they came, left the presbyters and people to the exerciſe of that right which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to them, although they joyned with them: Theſe are their formall expreſſions, out of which their conceſſion my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, yea, the whole ſyllogiſme, is not only confirmed and ſtrengthened, but the truth doth more evidently ſhine forth; for if the apoſtles left the presbyters &amp; people to the exerciſe of that right which belonged unto them, in all churches, and the presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters right be to rule as Eccleſiaſticall Magiſtrates, as to whom the power of the keyes peculiarly belongeth by Gods inſtitution, and the right of the people in all churches be to obey, as they are every where commanded; then it followeth neceſſarily, that it doth not belong unto the people to ordaine either deacons or presbyters, whatſoever they may doe in the chooſing of them, nor to excommunicate or caſt out any out of the Church, or to make members whom they pleaſe, nor to rule and governe the Church, which is the peculiar right of the presbyters, left unto them by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, for none of all theſe things was ever left unto the people, neither is there any preſident of it in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:158510:48"/>holy Scripture, ſo that while the Brethren ſeeme to contend for the liberty of the people, they plainely overthrow it; for they grant, that the Apoſtles left the Presbyters and people to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of that right belonged unto them, in all Churches, the right therefore of the keyes of government and juriſdiction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth properly unto the Presbyters in every Church, who are the Officers and Magiſtrates appointed by God himſelfe for that purpoſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 20. <hi>ver.</hi> 28. and therefore when the Apoſtles writ to the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> to excommunicate that inceſtuous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, although his Epiſtle be directed to the whole Church yet the Presbyters in that Church onely executed that act of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which of right belonged unto them, though the people al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo aſſented unto it, even as we ſee dayly, and experience teacheth us in all well ordered Corporations, when the King or Counſell writes unto any City ot Corporation, though their mandats be directed to the whole City or Corporation, for the raiſing either of men or moneyes, or about any other imployment of publike concernment, the Majors, Aldermen, and Common-Councell, and the Officers under them, onely manage the buſineſſe, for that is their right and place, and the people under them do yeeld obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and ſubmit themſelves to what they order and command, and intermeddle not in that imployment, as knowing very well it is their right and place onely to obey. And even ſo it was in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> the Presbyters onely exerciſed the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and ordered all according to the Apoſtles injunction, and the people aſſented unto it, and ſubmitted themſelves to the order; and the miſtaking of that place and many more hath been the cauſe of ſo much confuſion in the Church at this time, when not onely the men in every aſſembly, but the very women in many of the new Congregations, as Members, challenge a power and right both in the electing of Church Officers, and of admitting of Members, and of caſting out and excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, which before theſe our times, was never heard of in the world, when as the right of juriſdiction, and of the keyes, (as I have often proved) peculiarly belongeth unto the Presbyters, and the people, neither men nor women, ought to intermeddle with it, for if they ſhould, in ſhort time it would overthrow all go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Church and State, and bring confuſion into the world: But I conceive the cauſe of ſo groſſe a miſtake of that
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:158510:49"/>place concerning the excommunicating of the inceſtuous perſon, aroſe from this, that they looke upon the Church of Corinth and the other churches ſpoken of in the New Teſtament, not as corporations, as they were indeed, but as on their now ſucking independent new Congregations and Aſſemblies, ſuch as many of thoſe be, whereas thoſe ſeverall Churches are to be conſidered under another notion, as conſiſting of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, (as that of the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi>) united into one Church or body in the ſeverall Corporations, and each of them governed by a Common-councell of Presbyters, and by the joint conſent of three ſeverall Presbyters, all theſe ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations making but one Church, though never ſo much daily increaſed, and keeping ſtill the name and denomination of ſuch a Church, either from the place, city, country, or nation, or ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall language, as the Church of the Iewes, the Greeke Church, the Latine church: or from the Cities as the church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> of <hi>Epheſus, Rome, &amp;c.</hi> though they conſiſted of never ſo many Congregations and Aſſemblies, they ever kept the name of unity, and were accounted but one Church, in their ſeverall places, as at this day the Church of <hi>Geneva,</hi> though it conſiſt of many Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, is counted but one Church, as it is; ſo that I ſay, the conceiving of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> and thoſe ſeven churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> under the notion of one of their congregations, cauſed through this miſtake, that great confuſion that is now in the church, and was the originall cauſe of the opinion of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when notwithſtanding it is manifeſt, that thoſe very churches were not Independent, but made their appeale to the apoſtles and presbyters at <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> upon all occaſions, as that of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch;</hi> and it is ſaid that <hi>the Apoſtles and presbyters came together to conſider of that matter;</hi> which meeting of the Apoſtles and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters: for Synodicall acts of government is no weake proofe of meeting for presbyteriall acts of government, unleſſe men will ſuppoſe, that they who were carefull to aſſiſt other churches, did neglect their owne churches committed to their peculiar charge, and take no courſe of governing them.</p>
            <p>Yea <hi>Act,</hi> 15.2. it doth moſt certainly prove a presbyteriall government in <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> out of the which place I thus argue; <hi>Where the Apostles and Presbyters did governe, and many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations were by them ordered and governed, yet ſo, that all theſe
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:158510:49"/>congregations were one church, there was a presbyteriall govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but in the church of Ieruſalem the Apoſtles and Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters did governe, and many congregations were by them governed, yet ſo that all theſe congregations were one church;</hi> ergo, <hi>in the church of Jeruſalem, there was a Presbyterian government, all which is ſufficiently manifeſt out of the places above ſpecified, and from all the former diſcourſe.</hi> For in the 21. chapter it is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that there were many ten thouſands of beleevers in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> which could not all be contayned in a few places, but muſt of necetſſity be diſtributed into many and ſeverall congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and aſſemblies, all which notwithſtanding make but one church, as is evident, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. <hi>ver.</hi> 1. and many other places, the which congregations could not be one politique miniſteriall church, except onely becauſe they were united under one Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byteriall government, and therefore of neceſſity the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be ariſtocrattically and presbyterially governed, yea, the very mentioning ſo often of the Presbyters meeting together, proves that they met together about acts of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, from which I thus argue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That Scripture which proves a Presbytery in Jeruſalem, or an aſſociation of Presbyters in that church, proves that the presbyters of the church of Ieruſalem did meet together for acts of governe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and did really governe that church. But the places above coted prove a presbytry in Ieruſalem, or an aſſociation of presbyters in that church;</hi> ergo, <hi>they prove that they did meet together for acts of government, and did really governe that church, and that the church of Jeruſalem, conſiſting of many congregations, was presbyterially governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the major, the Brethren cannot deny it; for the very name of presbytery, ſignifieth a company or common-councell of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, governours, and magiſtrates; now all men know, that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernouts in common cannot do their duty, but muſt of neceſſity neglect the worke committed to them, if they do not meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for acts of government.</p>
            <p>Neither can they deny the minor, unleſſe they will deny the Scripture, for that expreſly declareth, that <hi>James</hi> and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters met together, and our Brethren take their warrant from that place, for the Presbyters meeting apart from the multitude to conſult, and to prepare matters: Yea, it is not onely ſet down,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:158510:50"/>that <hi>James</hi> and the Presbyters met together, which had it onely been for the entertainment of <hi>Paul,</hi> it is an argument ſufficient to convince any rationall man, that if the Presbyters would meet together for a ſalutation they did much more meet for acts of government: But I ſay it is not only ſpecified, that the Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters met together, but what they did in conſultation in that their meeting, and what they acted upon deliberation, and that was to adviſe <hi>Paul,</hi> and to direct him what he ſhould do, which coun<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cell of theirs was not <hi>lax,</hi> but reſtrictive and binding, <hi>ver.</hi> 23. <hi>Do therefore that which we ſay unto thee.</hi> By all which it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that they met about acts of government, when they gave an order and rule to <hi>Paul</hi> himſelfe, how he ſhould behave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe at that time, and we reade that <hi>Paul</hi> followed their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell, and ſubmitted himſelfe to their order; by all which it is moſt apparent, that the church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ordered and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the joint conſent and common-councell of Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, though conſiſting of many congregations, and was presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially governed.</p>
            <p>But I further thus argue, <hi>Where there were many aſſemblies in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and many presbyters, and theſe aſſemblies were all one church, and theſe presbyters all of them presbyters of that one church, there, of neceſſity there were many congregation under one preſbytery and that church was presbyterially governed; but in the church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>there were many aſſemblies, and many presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and thoſe aſſemblies were all one church, and thoſe presbyters all of them presbyters of that one church;</hi> ergo, <hi>in-the church of</hi> Ieruſalem <hi>there were many congregations under one presbytery, and that church was presbyterially governed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For the major, no man of ſound reaſon or judgement will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it.</p>
            <p>And for the firſt part of the minor, that there were many aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies in that church, it hath ſufficiently been proved in the foregoing diſcourſe and is evident out of the 21. chapter, where it is ſaid there were many ten thouſands.</p>
            <p>And for the other parts of it, that the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was but one Church and that all the Presbyters there were Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters of that one Church, the Brethren themſelves do acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; and they do alſo accord and grant that the Church of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> was governed by a Presbytery, and that it was presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rianly
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:158510:50"/>ruled; but withall they conceive the church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> to conſiſt of no more beleevers than might all meet together in one place and congregation; ſo that the difference between us and the Brethren is not whether the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> was presbyterianly governed or no, for that they doe acknowledge, and would have their Churches governed after that manner, but this is all the debate between us and them, whether there were no more beleevers in the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> than could all meet in one Congregation, which is their opinion; but whether or no, it hath not by the foregoing diſcourſe been ſufficiently proved, that there were more Congregations and Aſſemblies in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a greater number of beleevers than could all meet in any one place or Congregation, and that all theſe were under one presbitery: that I refer to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reader to judge of: and this ſhall ſuffice to have ſpoken of the third concluſion or propoſition.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the fourth, <hi>viz. That the Church of</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem <hi>and the government of the ſame, is to be a patterne for all Congregations and Aſſemblies in any City or vicinity, to unite into one church; and for the Officers and Presbiters of thoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations to governe that church joyntly, in a colledge or Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> And for the proofe of this there needs no great diſpute; for al men acknowledge, that the mother Church muſt give an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of government to all the daughter Churches, now then, when it doth evidently appeare, that this mother Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in her moſt flouriſhing condition, and by her firſt conſtitution, was confiſting of many Congregations and ſeverall Aſſemblies, and that they were all governed by a Presbitry, or a joynt and common Councell of Presbiters: then it followeth, that all other Churches ſhould be governed after the ſame manner as the mother Church was, to the end of the world; neither doe the brethren deny, but the government of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> muſt be the patterne of government to all Churches, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore out of that miſpriſion and miſtake, that ſhee was conſiſting of but as many as could meet in one Congregation, they take the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> for imitation, and teach all their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Congregations to doe the ſame, and to exerciſe the ſame power among themſelves independent, and to govern with as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute an authority in their ſeverall Congregations, as the whole
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:158510:51"/>Colledge of the Apoſtles and Presbiters did in the Church of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem</hi> and from the which they allow of no appeale as all that know their tenent can witneſſe: So that this laſt propoſition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrengthed both by reaſon and the conſent of the brethren, needs no further proofe.</p>
            <p>And now I come to the ſecond queſtion between us and the brethren, which is, concerning the manner of gathering of Churches and admitring of members and Officers, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether Miniſters of the Goſpell may out of already congregated Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of beleevers, ſelect and chooſe the moſt principle of them, into a Church-fellowſhip peculiar unto themſelves, and admit of none into their ſociety, but ſuch as ſhall enter in by a private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and are allowed of by the conſent and approbation of all the Congregation. And this queſtion brancheth it ſelfe into theſe ſeverall Queries: The firſt, whether for the gathering of Churches, there be either precept or preſident in the holy Word of God, that the Preachers and Miniſters of the Goſpell did ever leave their owne ordinary charges, to which they are called, and whereto they are fixed, with a command not to leave them, and under pretence of a new way, or a new borne truth, or a new light, did runne about and alienate the minds of the people, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected formerly to their ſeverall Miniſters as of duty they were bound as who had converted them to Chriſt by their miniſtery, and fed them ſtill with the ſincere milk of the Word, and built them up in their moſt holy faith: I ſay, the firſt <hi>quere</hi> is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there be precept or example in the Word of God of any true Miniſters ſo doing? and whether it was ever heard of in the Apoſtles &amp; primitive times that any beleeving Chriſtians were in great numbers congregated from among other beleeving Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and moulded into ſeveral Congregations and Aſſemblies, as ſeperate and diſtinct bodies and Churches from them, and who had no Church-fellowſhip with the other Congregations nor communicated with them in the Ordinances, but were indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from them, and abſolute among themſelves? and whether this way of gathering of Churches was ever heard of before theſe dayes? and whether this be to ſet Chriſt upon his Throne, to make deviſions and ſciſmes in churches, and among beleevers and brethren, and that upon groundleſſe pretences?</p>
            <p>The ſecond <hi>quere</hi> is, whether for the making of any man or
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:158510:51"/>woman a member of the church, it be requiſite or neceſſary, to the beleeving and being baptized, that they ſhould walk ſome dayes, weeks, moneths, perhaps years with them, that they may have experience of their converſation before they can be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and after that, a confeſſion of their faith ſhould be publikely made before the congregation, and the evidences of their conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, as, the time when, the place where, the occaſion how they were converted, ſhould likewiſe openly be produced for ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the church before they can be admitted to be members, and if any, either men or women ſhall except againſt their evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that then they are not to be admitted; this is the ſecond <hi>quere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The third is, whether for making any man or woman a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber or an officer of a church, the conſent of the whole congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the greater part of them beſides the Presbyters and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters be requiſite?</p>
            <p>The fourth <hi>quere</hi> is, whether for the admiſſion of any one into church-fellowſhip &amp; communion, a private ſolemn covenant be requiſite or neceſſary for the making of any one a member, the neglect or refuſall of the which, makes them incapable of their memberſhip and admiſſion? There is no queſtion between us and the brethren, about a publike covenant, for we have preſidents of that in holy Scripture, in all publike reformations.</p>
            <p>The fifth <hi>quere</hi> is, whether the women and people, as well as the Presbiters and Miniſters have the power of the Keyes, and whether the women have all their voices in the church, both for election and reprobation of members and officers, as well as the men, and whether the conſent of all the women, or the greateſt part of them, be requiſite for the making of any one a Member or Officer, ſo that if they gainſay it, being the greater number, or allow of it, the moſt voices carry the buſineſſe? this is the fifth <hi>quere,</hi> the practice of the which as of all the former, the brethren in ſome of their congregations hold for orthodox, and think all theſe things required of any that offer themſelves to be a member.</p>
            <p>The laſt <hi>quere</hi> is, whether the practice and preaching of all theſe things, and the gathering of churches after this manner, be to ſet up Chriſt as King upon his Throne? and whether churches and aſſemblies thus congregated be the onely true churches, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:158510:52"/>in the which onely, Chriſt rules and reignes as King, and all other that are not moulded up after this faſhion be no true congregated churches, and in the which Chriſt is not ſet up as King upon his Throne, which is the opinion of the brethren, as will afterward appeare.</p>
            <p>If I have failed in any thing in ſtating the queſtion, or in any of theſe <hi>Queres,</hi> the brethren muſt pardon me; for I ſpeake ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the practice of ſome of their congregations, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the doctrine many of them teach, not onely in their owne aſſemblies, but in every Pulpit through the Kingdome where they come, as I ſhall be able to prove: And therefore if I have been miſtaken in any thing, they may blame their owne practice and teachers, and thank themſelves alſo, that in the ſpace of almoſt two yeers (though it has been againe and again deſired at their hands) they have not ſo much as ſet down the modell of their government, and what they would have, with all the apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainances belonging unto it, that all the world might be out of doubt. What, therefore, I find practiſed amongſt ſome of the moſt zealous of them, and the moſt approved for integrity, and what I ſhall be able to prove, that I have without any ſpirit of bitterneſſe ſpecified: But now I ſhall ſet downe Gods method, and the Apoſtles practice in gathering of churches, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they uſed in making Members in every church, and compare it with the method our brethren the Independents uſe, in gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of their congregations, that all men may the better diſcerne truth from errour, and may all be undeceived in this buſineſſe of ſo great concernment. And I will firſt begin with Chriſts Commiſſion given to his Apoſtles, and in them to all Miniſters, and then conſider the practice of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and of all the Apoſtles and Miniſters in the primitive church and the order that God himſelfe uſed for the gathering of thoſe that belong unto his election, and for the congregating of the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> into the fold of Jeſus Chriſt, who is that great Shepheard and Biſhop of our ſoules; and I conceive that Gods order and the Apoſtles practice is rather to be followed than any other new-found way.</p>
            <p>But to begin with Chriſts commiſſion to his Apoſtles, <hi>Matth.</hi> 21. <hi>verſe</hi> 19.20. <hi>Goe yee therefore,</hi> ſaith Chriſt <hi>and teach all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, baptizing them, In the Name of the Father, Sonne and holy
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:158510:52"/>Ghoſt; teaching them to obſerve all things whatſoever I com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand you, and lo, I am with you, even to the end of the world, Amen.</hi> And in the 16. of <hi>Mark verſe,</hi> 15, 16. He ſaith unto them <hi>Goe yee into all the world, and preach the Gospell unto every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: He that beleeveth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved, but he that beleeveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> And in the 26. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> after he had declared the manner of his converſion to King <hi>Agrippa</hi> he likewiſe made knowne unto him the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had received from Chriſt Jeſus, in the words following, <hi>verſe</hi> 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. <hi>And I ſaid, who art thou Lord? and he ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt; but riſe and ſtand upon thy feet, for I have appeared unto thee for this purpoſe, to make thee a Minister and a Witneſſe, both of theſe things which thou haſt ſeene, and of thoſe things in the which I will appear unto thee, delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee to open their eyes, and to turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheritance among them which are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by faith which is in me; whereupon I was not diſobedient to the heavenly viſion, but ſhewed firſt unto them of</hi> Damaſcus <hi>and at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and through all the coasts of</hi> Judea, <hi>and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turne to God, and doe works meet for repentance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of theſe ſeverall places, from the commiſſion of Chriſt given to his bleſſed Apoſtles, and to all Miniſters and preachers of the Goſpel to the end of the world: here obſerve theſe things, Firſt, that their bounds and limits were ſet them, how farre they ſhould goe in their teaching all Nations, and beyond which they might not paſſe; and they were theſe, that they ſhould teach no other things but what Chriſt commanded them and appeared to them in, and for the which they had his word and warrant; and ſo long as they ſhould do this, he promiſed them and all that ſhould ſucceed them in the Miniſtry, to the end of the world to be with them. We alſo further obſerve the condition in the executing of this their commiſſion, they were to propound unto all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and people upon which they were to be admitted in to the Church, and that was faith and repentance, and they were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all ſuch as beleeved and were baptized, and that upon the profeſſion of their faith and repentance, without any further
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:158510:53"/>teſtimony of others, unleſſe they had bin formerly knowne to be open enemies and perſecutors of the Church, and then they were juſtly to be ſuſpected, till they had given publicke evidence by witneſſe to the Apoſtles and Miniſters of their true converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as it hapned to <hi>Paul,</hi> who for a time the Diſciples feared, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.26, 27. till they had better information and proofe that he now preached the faith that he had once perſecuted and had, ſuffered for it, which is the onely preſident we have in all the Acts of the Apoſtles of any that were refuſed to be admitted into the comu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion &amp; fellowſhip of the Apoſtles; as I remember (for he was a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter before) but all the other that came in were admitted upon their own offer, if they tendred themſelves and imbraced the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel &amp; were baptized, and that without any reluctation or ſcruple. The third thing we may obſerve, is that this comiſſion was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered only to the Apoſtles &amp; Miniſters of the Goſpell and that it was their place onely, who had the Keyes delivered unto them to open &amp; ſhut the doors of the Church, to admit ſuch as they thought for their faith, knowledge and repentance were ſufficiently qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified and fitted to be made members; and to refuſe ſuch as they conceived not fit to be received into the fellowſhip of the Church, either for their ignorance or other ſinnes and offences; and to caſt ſuch out of the Church, as through their malverſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on declared themſelves to be no beleevers: for the commiſſion was onely delivered unto the Apoſtles and Miniſters, <hi>that they ſhould admit who ſo ever beleeved and were baptized;</hi> and they that beleeved not and would not be baptized, were not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, This commiſſion I affirme, was onely given to the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles and Miniſters, and it was and is that office that peculiarly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longeth unto them.</p>
            <p>And if we looke into the method of Gods dealing with his Church in all ages, under the Law and under the Goſpell, both for the admitting of any into the Church as members and officers or the caſting out of any; and to all the practice of the Prophets and Prieſts of the old Teſtament, or the practice of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and the bleſſed Apoſtles in the time of the new Teſtament; we ſhall finde, that they that were admitted into the ſociety and fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Church, were by the Miniſters onely under both the Teſtaments received, and to them the people by God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe were ſent, and they ſent unto the people for this purpoſe.
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:158510:53"/>And for proofe of this I now ſay, I will firſt begin with the old Teſtament, a few teſtimonies of the which may ſerve for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of that truth, as that of <hi>Malachi</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 4, 5 6, 7. <hi>And yee ſhall know that I have ſent this my commandement unto you, that my covenant might be with</hi> Levy, <hi>ſaith the Lord of hoſts. My covenant was with him of life and peace, and I gave them to him, for the feare wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before my name. The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found in his lips, he walked with me in peace and equity and did turn many away from iniquity; for the Prieſts lips ſhall keepe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and they ſhall ſeeke the law at his mouth; for he is the meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger or angell of the Lord of hoſts.</hi> A ſufficient teſtimony to prove, that the Miniſters onely under the old Teſtament had the power given them of admitting of any into the fellowſhip and communion of the Church, and that all the people were directed to them as the Meſſengers and Angels of the Lord of hoſts, if they deſired to be admitted into the Church. And ſo <hi>Jeremy</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiel,</hi> as we read in the firſt chapters of both their propheſies, and the ſame may be ſaid of all the Prophets, they were ſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people. The people were to be directed by them and the Prophets and Prieſts onely had that power delegated unto them of proclaiming both mercies and judgements, and of receiving into the Church ſuch as ſhould come unto them. And under the new Teſtament in the third of <hi>Matthew</hi> we finde <hi>Jeruſalem and all Judea, and all the regions round about Jeruſalem</hi> going out to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, <hi>and were baptized of him,</hi> and admitted into the Church by him alone without the people; and the ſubſtance of his preaching with his manner of admitting of members into the Church, and the conditions upon which he received them, and what the people did before their admiſſion, is all fully ſet downe in the third of <hi>Luke</hi> and the ſeventh. And for the ſumme of his preaching, it is ſaid, verſe the third, that it was <hi>the baptiſme of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</hi> And for thoſe that came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, as the common people, the Publicans and the Souliders, they all aske <hi>Iohn</hi> what they ſhould doe? and after he had inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted them ſeverally their duties, and told them upon what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions they might be admitted, it is ſaid in the ſeventh of <hi>Luke</hi> verſe 29. <hi>that all the people that heard him, and the publicans ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified God, being baptized with the baptiſme of Iohn; but the
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:158510:54"/>Phariſes and the Lawyers rejected the counſel of God againſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,</hi> being not baptized of him. So that by Chriſts owne te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony (the Phariſes and Lawyers onely excepted) all that came to him were baptized and admitted into the Church without the conſent of the people. And ſo we finde in the Goſpell of Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> cha. 3.4. yea, through the whole booke, that the people eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where made their addreſſes to <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt, and to Chriſt and his Apoſtles onely; and that as many as came to Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fainedly, were received by him and his Apoſtles, and none upon the offer of themſelves, if they accepted of the conditions and were baptized were ever refuſed. And we finde further, that when our Saviour had at any time clenſed and cured the Lepers, he ſent them to the Prieſts for to be admitted by them into the communion of the Church, from which their noiſome diſeaſe, as a type of ſinne, had for the time excluded them.</p>
            <p>But now to goe on, after the reſurrection and aſcention of Chriſt, and that the Apoſtles had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, and at their firſt entring upon their miniſtry, had preached unto the people, &amp; that the people were pricked in their hearts when they heard them; it is ſaid that the people addreſſed themſelves onely unto <hi>Peter</hi> and the other Apoſtles, ſaying, <hi>Men and Brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Then <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid unto them, <hi>Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Ieſus Chriſt for the remiſſion of ſins, and ye ſhall receive the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.</hi> Act. 2.37, 38. <hi>then they that gladly received the word were baptized, and the ſame day were added unto them about three thouſand ſoules.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may obſerve theſe two things: The firſt, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles by themſelvs alone, without the multitude or Church admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the people into the ſociety &amp; company of beleevers. Secondly, that in the execution of their commiſſion, they did nothing but according to their warrant, and according to their injunction that was given unto them by Chriſt, they propounded no other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or termes for their making all and every one of them members of the Church but baptiſme and repentance; the which when the people had accepted of, they were forthwith admitted, and that upon their owne word and teſtimony, without any more adoe, or further inquiry. Concerning the ſoundneſſe of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, without any witneſſe from others of their converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and without the voyce, allowance or approbation of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:158510:54"/>or the multitude of beleevers in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> much leſſe of the whole Church, who were never joyned with the Apoſtles in their comiſſion or conſulted with by them, whether they ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted or no into the fellowſhip of the faithfull, or demanded or asked by the people whether it were not fit that they ſhould take ſome time of further conſideration, that they might walke with them, to the end that they might behold their converſation, and by their owne experience might further be confirmed that their converſion was ſound and well: Neither did any call for at their hands, that they ſhould make a publike confeſſion of their faith to the Church, and give in evidences to the Congregation, that they were converted really, or that they ſhould take a private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, or enter into the church by way of a peculiar covenant: nothing of all this is ſpecified: But it is onely related, that the people upon their being pricked in their hearts applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Apoſtles, and that the Apoſtles by their owne au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and that power that was delegated unto them without reference to the church or people, admitted them into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of beleevers.</p>
            <p>We further may take notice, that when the Angell appeared unto <hi>Cornelius</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he ſent him unto <hi>Joppa,</hi> to call for one <hi>Simon,</hi> whoſe ſurname was <hi>Peter;</hi> he did not ſend him unto the Church in <hi>Joppa.</hi> And it is related, that when <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> came to <hi>Cornelius,</hi> and that he had recited unto him the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the viſion, and that he was commanded by the Angell to ſend for him; it is further alſo declared what <hi>Peter</hi> there did, and that he ſaid, <hi>of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but in every Nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſnes is accepted with him.</hi> And after a Sermon made unto <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius</hi> and all that were aſſembly there with him; It is ſaid, that <hi>the holy Ghoſt fell on all them that heard the word, and that all the beleevers that came with Peter were aſtoniſhed at it, for they heard them ſpeake with divers tongues and magnified God. Then anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Peter, can any man forbid water that theſe men ſhould not be baptized, which have received the holy Ghoſt as well as we? And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord.</hi> Here we ſee firſt, that <hi>Peter</hi> was ſent unto, and not the Church: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that he admitted <hi>Cornelius</hi> and thoſe that were with him into the number of beleevers and into the fellowſhip of the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:158510:55"/>Church by his owne authority, and never conſulted with the Church to aske their leave or voyce but concludes the buſineſſe with an interrogation which hath a greater force of binding that no man ought to hinder any beleever from comming into the ſociety of the Church and communion of Saints, in whom the graces of God ſpirit evidently appeare as in theſe; ſo that if ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Miniſters come into their houſes, or they goe into the Miniſters and make ſufficient teſtimony by themſelves of their faith and that they feare God, of what nation ſoever they be, they are by the Miniſters to be admitted; the congregation hath nothing to doe to hinder any ſuch, nay, they may not, it is more than belongs unto them; neither did thoſe that came with <hi>Peter</hi> intermeddle in that buſineſſe or require a covenant at their hand, or a publike confeſſion of faith.</p>
            <p>Againe when the Lord of his infinite mercy was purpoſed to reveale himſelf unto the <hi>Eunuch</hi> in the 8 of the <hi>Acts,</hi> he ſendeth <hi>Phillip</hi> the Evangeliſt unto him, whom he found reading in his Chariot, the propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and after that he had interpreted unto him that propheſie and preached unto him Jeſus and Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in his name it is related <hi>that when they came unto acer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine water the Eunuch ſaid unto him, what doth hinder me to be baptized? and</hi> Philip <hi>ſaid if thou beleeveſt with all thine heart, thou mayeſt:</hi> And he anſwered and ſaid, <hi>I beleeve that Jeſus Chriſt is the Sonne of God: and he commanded the Chariot to ſtand ſtill and they went downe both into the water, both</hi> Philip <hi>and the Eunuch and he baptized him.</hi> Here we ſee that <hi>Philip</hi> and not the Church was ſent unto the Eunuch and that <hi>Philip</hi> by his owne authority, and upon the Eunuch his owne teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without any reference unto the Church or without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with the Congregation admits him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of the Church and here was neither a publik confeſſion required of him by any of the Church, or any covenant exacted by the people: and ſo when <hi>Saul</hi> in the 9. of the <hi>Acts</hi> was fallen downe out of aſtoniſhment, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards was converted as the ſtory there fully declareth the whole manner of it, the Lord ſent one <hi>Ananias</hi> a Diſciple and Miniſter unto him; he did not ſend the Church unto him, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did <hi>Ananias</hi> when he came to <hi>Saul,</hi> ſay unto him. I will conſult with the Church to ſee whether they will admit thee to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:158510:55"/>be a member, for thou haſt greatly waſted the Church, and made havock of the Saints, and therefore I will have their approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and conſent, and I will have thee firſt walk with the Church ſome time, that they may behold thy converſation, and then thou ſhalt make a confeſſion of thy faith publikely before the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and give in thy evidences of the truth of thy converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and enter in a private and ſolemne covenant, and ſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and admitted. But without all this adoe he baptizes <hi>Paul</hi> and admitteth him into the number of beleevers, and makes him a member of the Church, and that by his ſole authority, and he was received immediately among the Diſciples at <hi>Damaſcus</hi> without any reluctation, or ſo much as any ſcruple, and <hi>ſtrait-way he preached Chriſt in the Sinagogue that he was the Son of God;</hi> he was both ordained and put in office without the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and conſent of the people, who knew nothing of the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but <hi>onely ſtood amazed,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>Is not this he that destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them which called on this name in</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the high Prieſt?</hi> The Miniſters in thoſe dayes when they were all taught of God, they onely admitted members by their owne authority into the Church, without the approbation of the people; but in theſe our dayes, wherein people have gotten itching eares, and teachers after their owne humours (ſuch as S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy</hi>) they teach a new doctrine, and bring forth new borne lights, to the darkning of truth it ſelfe, and to the bringing in of confuſion on all things. See what Saint <hi>James</hi> ſaith in his 5. chapt. to all Churches and Chriſtians in the world, <hi>It any man ſick,</hi> ſaith he? <hi>let him ſend for the Presbiters of the Churches, and let them pray over him, &amp;c. and the prayer of faith ſhall ſave the ſicke and the Lord ſhall raiſe him up, and if he have committed ſins, they ſhal be forgiven him.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> here ſends all Chriſtians to the Presbiters of every Church, who had the power of the Keys delegated unto them for ſpirituall comfort, and whoſe office onely it was to pronounce pardon and remiſſion of ſinnes unto the ſick upon their true repentance, if they had offended and ſinned againſt God in the time of their health, and ſo ſcandalized the Goſpell and the Church; and it was the Presbiters place and office to admit them againe into the fellowſhip and communion of the Saints upon their cordiall and
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:158510:56"/>unfained repentance, and that without asking the Church any leave; for as the Presbiters onely had the power of caſting out offenders out of the Church, ſo they onely had the authority of receiving them in againe upon their repentance, and not the Church; ſo if we look into all thoſe Epiſtles that were written unto the ſeven Churches of <hi>Aſia</hi> in the 2. and 3. of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> we ſhall find them all directed to the Angels of the ſeven Churches, which is as much as to ſay, to the preſidents of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Presbitry eſtabliſhed and conſtituted in every one of thoſe Churches; which is a ſufficient argument to me, to prove a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell or Colledge of godly Miniſters in every one of thoſe Cities, according to that of <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Titus</hi> chap. 1. ver. 5. for this cauſe left <hi>I thee in</hi> Creet <hi>that thou ſhouldeſt ordaine Presbiters in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry City,</hi> not one but many. And in the 14. of the <hi>Acts ver.</hi> 23. <hi>And when they had ordained them presbiters in every Church, &amp;c.</hi> many Presbiters, a Colledge of them was appointed to every Church: and ſo in the 20. of the <hi>Acts,</hi> there were many Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters who had the charge and government of that Church commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto them in common, <hi>ver.</hi> 28. there was a Colledge of them conſtituted in that church, and therefore for order ſake (which the light of nature teacheth) they muſt have a Preſident, who by the way of excellency, and to diſtinguiſh him from the other, is called an Angel, as the inſcription of the Epiſtle <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.1. de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, ſaying, <hi>Unto the Angel of the church of Epheſus.</hi> As in our dialect, when we ſpeak of the great counſell of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or of the reverend aſſembly of Divines, if there be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of diſtinguiſhing the Preſidents of thoſe councels from the other Judges in thoſe aſſemblies, we ſay, Maſter Speaker in the Houſe of Lords or Commons, or of the Preſident of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, we ſay, Maſter Prolocutor; and if any have occaſion to write to either houſes or to the Aſſembly, they direct their letters to the Speakers, or to the Prolocutor, who communicates them to each Aſſemblies, as being the Preſidents of each Society, and yet none of all theſe Preſidents by that their place of honour and eminency have any more power or authority then the reſt, but onely in the caſting voyce when the parties upon any occaſion are for number equall, and for appointing of the times and places of meeting, and for the methodicall and orderly carriage of the buſineſſes; yea, it is ever obſerved, whereſoever there is a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:158510:56"/>there is a colledge or councell, or a court, nature dictates this, and the cuſtome of all nations proves it: and withall, by the ſame light of reaſon, that counſell or colledge to whom God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe writes and directs his letters for redreſſing of abuſes, has the power in their hands for the rectifying of things amiſſe &amp; that it peculiarly belongeth unto them as to the Magiſtrates inveſted with authority, to order things according to direction, and to puniſh and caſt out offenders; and that by their owne power, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent and approbation of the people, as it is now in the great Counſell and Parliament of the Kingdome; who make not the people acquainted with what they have to doe, but ſo farre as it pleaſeth themſelves, and not out of any duty: and ſo it was in the government of Gods Church by the firſt conſtitution, every Church conſiſting of many congregations, were governed by a colledge of Presbiters, as that of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and this of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and the other ſix Churches; in all the which the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biters by their ſole authority governed them according to Gods Word, without taking the people in to counſell with them, who were no where joyned in commiſſion with them: and therefore it is moſt apparent by thoſe examples I have now produced, and many more that might be added; and from the commiſſion that Chriſt gave to the Apoſtles, and in them to all Miniſters, that the people had not their voyces, either for the admitting of any to be members in any church, or in the eaſting out of any for their delinquency much leſſe have they authority to require a publike confeſſion of their faith to be made unto the congregation, or to exact of them to bring in the evidences of their true conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, or to require that they ſhould walk with them ſome time before admiſſion, or to enter into a ſolemne private covenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be admitted as members, for we have no preſident for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe things in Gods Word, much leſſe any command, only in <hi>Acts</hi> the ſixt, there is mention made, that the Apoſtles for the freeing of themſelves from all unneceſſary incombrances, and that they might the better attend upon their miniſtry and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, gave the people liberty to make choice of their owne Deacons, but ſtill keeping the power of ordaining them in their owne hand, which alwayes was arbitrary in them whether they would exerciſe it or no, neither would the Apoſtles have ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, unleſſe thoſe that were to be ordained, had been man
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:158510:57"/>ſo qualified as they had appointed; for otherwiſe, it lay in their choyce whether they would ordain them or no. But that ever the congregation or people had the power of admitting of members, or of ordaining of Officers, it is no where extant in Gods Word: But that the women ſhould have a voyce in the Church, either for receiving in, or caſting out of members or officers, or ſhould have any thing to doe with <hi>Peters</hi> Keys, it is againſt the law of God and nature: For <hi>Paul</hi> in the firſt Epiſtle to the Corinths, 14. makes it one of the marks of confuſion in any Church where women have their voyces, ſaying, <hi>God is not the Author of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, but of peace, as in all the churches of the Saints;</hi> and in the next verſe following in expreſſe words ſaith. <hi>Let your women keep ſilence in churches, for it is not permitted unto them to ſpeak, but they are comanded to be under obedience as alſo ſaith the law: and if they wil learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home, for it is a ſhame for women to ſpeake in the church.</hi> And what S. <hi>Paul</hi> writ to this Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> he writ to all Churches, and proclaims that what he writ to them <hi>were the commandements of the Lord,</hi> ver. 37. ſo that God had commanded that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſhould not ſpeak in the Church, and ſayth that it is a ſhame they ſhould: and yet in theſe our dayes, and in many of the new congregations, they have their voyces in chooſing of officers and admitting of members, and have all of them <hi>Peters</hi> Keys as their Girdle, and make learned parts of ſpeech in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſpute queſtions and debate of matters and give their reaſons <hi>con &amp; pro</hi> as it is credibly reported and others of them ſet forth and print learned Treatiſes in polemicall divinity with great applauſe and admiration of the Independent Miniſters who cite their authority, and quote them in their writings as claſſicall authors, to the ſhame of the Nation and ludibry of Religion: and howſoever there is not any that ſhall more honour the truly vertuous and pious of that ſex than my ſelfe, yet I muſt confeſſe when I ſee how farre they become tranſgreſſors of the law of God &amp; do thoſe things that the holy Apoſtle hath not onely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden but proclaimed a ſhame; I cannot but exceedingly blame them, &amp; thoſe Miniſters that allow of and approve of ſuch rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion againſt God and nature. And as if it had been the ſpecial care in the Apoſtle to prevent this evill of womens intermedling in matters of the Church, he foreſeeing the confuſion that would
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:158510:57"/>be brought in upon it: In his firſt Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him to all Miniſters, to whom the government of the Church was committed, he gives him direction <hi>how to behave himſelfe in the houſe of God, which is the church of the living God;</hi> in cap. 2. ver. 11.12. he ſaith <hi>Let the women learne in ſilence, with all ſubjection; for I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurpe autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the man but to be in ſilence; for</hi> Adam <hi>was firſt made, then</hi> Eve; <hi>and</hi> Adam <hi>was not deceived, but the woman being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was in the tranſgreſſion &amp;c.</hi> Here the Apoſtle again and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun twice in theſe few words, enjoyns them ſilence in the church, and impoſes upon them ſubjection and obedience: <hi>I ſuffer not,</hi> ſaith he <hi>a woman to teach or to uſurpe authority over the man, but to be in ſilence;</hi> and he giveth his reaſons of this his command, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> ſaith he Adam <hi>was firſt made</hi> not by the woman nor of the woman, but the contrary; and therfore ſhe may uſurpe no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity over the maſculine ſex eſpecially in Gods matters and ſhee is to be the diſciple if the man, and not the man her ſchollar: and therefore that ſuperiority that the God of order had eſtabliſhed upon the man in the firſt creation, he doth now re-eſtabliſh upon him againe in his holy Word, after all things through ſinne had been diſordered and confuſed; and commands the woman to be both ſubject and ſilent eſpecially in the Church. Another rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this his command is, becauſe the woman was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, and was the cauſe of <hi>Adams</hi> fall, as he accuſes her, and her diſputing and voycing of it then brought confuſion upon all mankind; and for this her ſo doing. S. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hereafter, that ſhe ought to hold her peace &amp; be in ſubjection to her husband, and ought to learne in ſilence at home, but more eſpecially in the Church; for if they come to voyce it once again in the Church. as <hi>Eve</hi> brought confuſion upon mankind by her diſputation and reaſons, ſo theſe with their loquacity and babble and confuſion of voyces. will bring in a new <hi>Babel</hi> into the Church and State as they have prettily well already begun to doe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>I ſuffer not a woman to teach, nor to uſurpe authority over the man, but to be in ſilence.</hi> Here the Apoſtle as in the place above cited, out of the Cor. chap. 14. commands them ſilence and permits them not to ſpeak, and expreſly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bids them to uſurpe authority over the man that is, the virill ſex. Now I appeale unto any underſtanding creature, whether or no,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:158510:58"/>to make large parts of ſpeech in the Church (as many of them upon occaſions doe) and diſpute and give their reaſons <hi>con &amp; pro,</hi> be not to ſpeak in the Church? and whether to have their voyces in either admitting of members or officers, or in the caſting of them out, be not to uſurpe authority over the man? for all the world knowes, that they that have the power in their hands of either admitting of any into the fellowſhip or communion of the Church, or of hindring their comming in, or have their voyces for the caſting of them out when they are received, exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and uſurpe authority over thoſe they ſo deale with; and therefore they doe againſt the expreſſe prohibition of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, and all thoſe women that have uſurped this authority, and all thoſe Miniſters that have permitted them ſo to doe, or tanght this doctrine unto them, are all guilty of great contumacy againſt God, and ought ſeriouſly to repent for this their temerity and rebellion, and it will be the immortall honour of thoſe women that have not intermedled; &amp; if there be not ſome ſpeedy courſe taken by authority to forbid ſuch diſorder, we may promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the Church and whole Kingdome but confuſion. It has ever been obſerved that Hermaphrodite counſels in any King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or country, when women that are ſubjects intermeddle in government and matters of ſtate, that that Kingdome and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try is very craſed and not far from ruine and deſtruction; and we need not look into many ages or countries for preſidents of this kind; &amp; if hermaphrodite counſels in Kingdoms has ever been ſo fatall unto them, what may any man think in time will become of this Church and Kingdome, when the women have gotten <hi>Peters</hi> Keys at their girdle, and have their voyces in many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations, and a power of ordering and diſpoſing of things in Church affaires? certainly; nothing but confuſion can be expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted; for this their doing is againſt the expreſſe command of God, who is the God of order, and injoynes the contrary: yea, it is not onely againſt the law of God, but againſt the very law of nature and the practice of all Nations; for never was it yet heard of in any well governed city, or common wealth, or Kingdome, that women that were ſubjects had their voyces in chooſing offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers or Burgeſſes, or making of freemen, or disfranchiſing of them, or were permitted ſo much as to ſit in counſell with them, much leſſe to rule and give lawes to others out of their owne
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:158510:58"/>houſes: And therefore as it is a thing odious to God and man, and that which is a ſhame to that ſex it ought to be caſt out of all wel-governed Churches and States; and as the women ought to know their places, ſo ought all men that are under obedience to learne their duty, and not to take upon them that which God never gave unto them, as to have their voyce either in making of members in Churches, or caſting of them out, or of ordaining of officers, or of impoſing lawes upon others, either of making pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like confeſſions before the Congregations, or of producing evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their converſion, or that they ſhould walk with them ſome time that they might behold their converſation, or of impoſing a covenant upon any that ſhall be admitted; for all rule and government in the Church is put into the hands of the Presbiters, and does not belong unto the people or multitude, neither may the Presbiters uſurpe authority, but they alſo muſt exerciſe it onely, according to the commiſſion given unto them by Chriſt, they may not tranſgreſſe it or goe beyond it in the leaſt thing; and therefore when many of the brethren call for a publike confeſſion of mens faith to be made in their new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and the evidences of their converſion to be produced, and impoſe a covenant upon them before they admit them to be members of their Church, (as if they had lived before in infide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity; Who notwithſtanding were knowne to be holy and godly Chriſtians, and as true beleevers as any that now live in the world) and think them onely Chriſtians and beleevers that doe as they would have them, and count of others that will not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme themſelves to their cuſtomes and novelties, but as the off-ſcowring and refuſe and no Chriſtians: I ſay it is an intolerable uſurpation, and a thing that was yet never before practiſed in the world, in any Church either Jewiſh or Chriſtian till theſe dayes, and therefore they goe beyond their commiſſion in ſo doing; for God in his commſſion to his Apoſtles and all Miniſters, bids them admit of all that come in and beleeve and are baptized, he quencheth not the ſmoaking flax nor breaketh the bruiſed reed; now then, when they know thouſands in this Kingdome that doe beleeve, and are men of unblamable lives, and ſuch as would lay downe their lives for the faith once delivered unto the Saints and are baptized; what have they to doe to lord it over them, and to hinder them from communicating in the Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:158510:59"/>and to be admitted into Church-fellowſhip with them, or to debarre them from the communion of the Saints? Me thinks the viſion to Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in the tenth of the <hi>Acts</hi> ſhould teach ſuch men their duty, <hi>When God ſaid unto</hi> Peter <hi>riſe kill and eat,</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid not ſo Lord, for I have never eaten any thing that is common and uncleane; and the voyce ſaid what God hath cleanſed call not thou common.</hi> And this, ſaith the Scripture, was done thrice, that by the mouth of two or three Witneſſes this truth might be confirmed to <hi>Peter</hi> and all other Miniſters, not to call thoſe people common, prophane and uncleane, and to count them but rubbiſh, whom God hath graced with the gifts of his holy Spirit, and hath ſanctified, and ſuch as beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt and are baptized as well as themſelves, and ſuch as ſtood to the truth when they durſt not ſhew their faces, but ran from the Cauſe and deſerted it, or at leaſt temporized, and ſuch as if the like occaſions were offered, would manifeſt unto the world (by Gods aſſiſtance) that their lives and all they have ſhould not be deere unto them for the teſtimony of Jeſus; and yet ſuch as theſe muſt be debarred from the communion in their aſſemblies, unleſſe they will conforme to their new-borne traditions; for theſe are no traditions of the Elders, but of the younger: and if Chriſt in his time ſharply reproved thoſe that brake the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God through the traditions of men, and deeply reproved the Miniſters in thoſe dayes for teaching the people to preferre the traditions of the Elders before the commandements of God, and for teaching them the feare of God after the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of men: What ſhall we think thoſe Miniſters will have to anſwer at the dreadfull day of judgement, when they ſet up their traditions in the Church of God, and preferre them before the Commandements of God? and what can any man think of the condition of that people, that account of ſuch novelties as the Oracles of God, and violate the law of Love, and make rents and ſciſmes in the ſeameleſſe garment of the Church through theſe traditions? Surely whatſoever they may promiſe to themſelves, their condition is very dangerous; for our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Woe be to thoſe by whom offences come,</hi> Matthew 18. <hi>and whoſoever ſhall offend one of theſe little ones that beleeve in me, it were better for him that a milſtone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the ſea.</hi> And whether this be not to
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:158510:59"/>tranſgreſſe the Commandements of God through their traditions and to offend thoſe little ones that beleeve in Chriſt, when they will not receive ſuch into the communion and fellowſhip of the Church, as beleeve and are baptized, but count them as aliens and ſtrangers, yea infidels and rubbiſh, I referre my ſelfe to any that is but of ordinary underſtanding? For Gods command unto all Miniſters was, that they ſhould admit all ſuch into the Church as beleeved and were baptized upon their deſiring it, without any confeſſion either private or publike, or entring into any covenant: Now this command of God they tranſgreſſe by their traditions, and keepe out many thouſands of beleevers through the Kingdome, as unholy, and as having no right to the Ordinances, becauſe forſooth they will not obey their new-born lawes and traditions; for where did ever God command that no beleevers ſhould be admitted into the Church except they made a publike confeſſion of their faith, and walked ſome time in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip amongſt them, and then give in the evidences of their converſion, and entred into a private covenant, and gave the Church ſatisfaction? Or where was it ever practiſed by any of the primitive Chriſtians either by thoſe that were converted by <hi>Peters</hi> Sermon and the other Apoſtless, or by <hi>Paul's</hi> preaching? was <hi>Lidia</hi> (when God opened her heart to beleeve <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching) admitted into the Church upon any ſuch termes? was the Goaler and his converted family forced to make a publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion to the Church of their faith &amp; to give in the evidences of their converſion and to enter into a private covenant before they could be made members of the Church, or was the Churches aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent required before they could be admitted and made members of it, or were ever any of theſe things they impoſe upon Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians now, required at beleevers hands before theſe our times? and therefore they are to be abominated as vaine traditions, and ſuch as by which they break the lawes of God, making deviſions in the Church and Kingdome, and through all the families, and houſes of the ſame, ſo that neither maſters of families nor pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have any rule over their wives, children or ſervants, their husbands goe out one way, the wife another, their children to this aſſembly, their ſervants to that congregation, and as it was among the Corinthians which <hi>Paul</hi> blames in them, one ſaid, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> another I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the third I am of <hi>Coephas,</hi>

            <p>And by all that I have now ſpoke, I hope it doth ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare that there is neither precept nor example through all the holy Scripture to warrant the practice of theſe men in the gathering of their new Churches; and if a man will but looke a little more upon the practice of Chriſts ſeventy Diſciples &amp; of all the Apoſtles in the gathering of Churches they ſhall not find one footſtep through the whole booke of God of the gathering Churches after the manner of their congregating of their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies: as for Chriſts Diſciples, they were all ſent to gather in the loſt ſheep of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they went not to gather in converted men from amongſt converted men, for they were to bring the loſt ſheep into Chriſts fold (and we are taught there is but one Shepheard and one ſheepfold) we never read that after they were once folded and brought into the Church, that any true Paſtors came into the fold and flocks of their fellow-ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards and picked out all the beſt and the fatteſt ſheep, and the moſt wholſome, and molded them into an independent fould by themſelves, as ſeperate and diſtinct from the others, and with the which they would have no fellowſhip and communion in the Ordinances, this was never heard of before theſe dayes: <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo farre from getting away of others ſheep that he took it for a diſhonour to him to build upon anothers foundation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and preached Chriſt in thoſe places where they had never heard of him before; and planted the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:158510:60"/>and left <hi>Apollo</hi> to water it, and committed all the flocks that he had gathered, as that of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> to the charge and care of faithful Paſtors, and commands both the flocks and the Paſtors and in them all ſhepheards and folds, to keep unity and love one with another, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. and forbids them to make ſeperations and deviſions, and ſciſmes between flock and flock, and this method he uſed whereſoever he came; yea, as ſoon as he was converted and entred upon his miniſtry, as we may ſee in the firſt of the <hi>Galatians,</hi> he went into <hi>Arrabia</hi> and preached there among the poore Infidels, he got not other mens ſheep from them, neither did he ever make any ſeperation of ſheep from ſheep, yea, even in thoſe flocks and Churches, as that of <hi>Corinth, Galatia</hi> and <hi>Coloſſe,</hi> where there were many that walked diſorderly and againſt the rules preſcribed, and taught falſe doctrine and hereſies, and made ſciſmes in the Church, and were very ſcandalous, ſo that if ever there were in any Churches a juſt cauſe of making a ſeperation, it was then; and yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles bid not the Chriſtians ſeperate themſelves from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion and aſſemblies of the Saints, and from the Ordinances for theſe mens cauſes, but onely that they ſhould look unto themſelves, and examine their owne conſciences, that they may not offend, and ſo make themſelves unworthy of the holy things, and gives them power to caſt out the prophane, but no way tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates them to ſeperate; onely he bids them not be familiar with ſuch as walk diſorderly, that by this meanes they might learne to amend their lives, and tels them of what judgements have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes happened to ſuch as were wicked, and bids them by their example to take heed how they provoke God by the like, as it is at large ſet downe in the tenth chapter, and commands them to make no ſeparation, but from Idolaters and Infidels: and ſo likewiſe in his Epiſtle to the Galatians, he ſayes for his owne par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, he could wiſh that they that troubled them were cut off, yet he biddeth not the Galatians to ſeparate themſelves into in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent congregations.</p>

            <p>I have been ever taught in Gods holy Word, that thoſe faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Miniſters that preached Jeſus Chriſt and him crucified, and opened the eyes of the blind, and turned them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Satan unto God, that they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and taught the people that they ſhould repent and turne to God, and doe works meet for repentance; and that inſtructed all men that they being delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out of the hands of their enemies, they ſhould ſerve God without feare, in holineſſe and righteouſneſſe before him all the dayes of their life, and teaching them that the grace of God bringing ſalvation, hath appeared to all men, for this very end that they ſhould deny all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, and ſhould live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who gave himſelfe for us that he might redeeme us from all iniquitie, and purifie unto himſelfe a peculiar people zealous of good works. I ſay I have been ever taught by Gods holy Word, to beleeve that thoſe Miniſters that inſtruct the people to do al theſe things, and where the people by faith imbrace and receive this doctrine, are the true Miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; thoſe congregations under them the church of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and of his ſheepfold, and that Chriſt in all ſuch congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations is ſet up as King in his Throne, as who rules in the hearts of his people, and the which are ſwayed and guided by the Scep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of his Word and Spirit, and deſerve none of thoſe contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melious languages the brethren aſperſe both Miniſters and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple with.</p>

            <p>Theſe are ſome of his formall expreſſions, I leave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe ſeverall paſſages to others: neither doe I rehearſe innumerable ſuch like ſentences as are daily vented, to the into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable diſgrace both of all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> &amp; of all thoſe beleeving chriſtians that are under their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charges, &amp; that in every pamphlet in the which they proclaim all the Miniſters to be the ſworne and profeſſed enemies of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch as deny, diſclaime and preach againſt Chriſts kingly government over mens conſciences and Churches; and for the people and beleevers in <hi>England,</hi> they proclaime them to be men unconverted, or at leaſt converted but in part, wanting the maine thing, Chriſts Kingly office; men viſibly out of the covenant of grace, who have not ſo much as an outward profeſſion of the faith; who deny Chriſt to be their King, to whoſe perſons and Infants the very Sacraments and ſeales of grace, with all church-communion, may and ought to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>By the which words, they not onely unchurch all the congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of <hi>England, Scotland, Ireland,</hi> but indeed all the reformed churches, and unchriſtian all chriſtians but thoſe that are in their owne independent aſſemblies, and account them as aliens and ſtrangers from the common-wealth of the Saints, and make Chriſt to be no King over them, or to have any Kingdome in or amongſt them, but onely amongſt themſelves in their new con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations: wheras Chriſt ever had a church or Kingdome upon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:158510:62"/>earth in all ages before they were, and hath without all contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſie a true Kingdome in many churches in theſe our dayes, where they are not. Had I not ſeen their expreſſions in print, and the book in which they are uttered, ſet forth by authority with approbation, I ſhould not have beleeved that they had all of them bin ſo uncharitable; but finding that book not only printed by licenſe, but generally applauded by them all and much mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, as the frequent edititions of it doe manifeſt, I gather, it is the univerſall opinion of them all. Than, the which, what could be more uncharitably and unchriſtianly ſpoken? what comfort can any of the Miniſters of the church of <hi>Engand</hi> have in the ſociety of theſe men, who (whatſoever outward ſeeming favour they ſhew to them) in their hearts conceive of them as the ſworne enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and as men unworthy to live, and who count it a diſhonorable thing to their Lord &amp; Maſter, to maintain thoſe black-coats with tythes, whom they look on as the profeſſed enemies of their anointed Chriſt? can, I ſay, any Miniſters with joy and alacrity converſe with theſe men? no ſurely; what reall comfort can any poore chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an beleevers through the Kingdome either expect or look for at theſe mens hands if they were in their power, whom they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare (and that in print, and in their Pulpits) to be men uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, or converted but in part, wanting the main thing, Chriſts Kingly office, men viſibly out of the covenant of grace, who have not ſo much as an outward profeſſion of faith, who deny Chriſt to be their King; to whoſe perſons and Infants the very Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ſeals of grace, with all church-communion, may and ought to be denied? can any true chriſtians be reall friends to the enemies of Chriſt? <hi>He</hi> (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>cor. chap.</hi> 16. <hi>v.</hi> 22) <hi>that loveth not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, let him be Anathama Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranatha;</hi> will any true Chriſtians bleſſe thoſe that God hath curſt? <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>I hate them that hate thee, yea, I hate them with a perfect hatred:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſurely thoſe that are true friends to Chriſt, hate all his enemies; now they looke upon our Miniſters as the profeſt enemies of Chriſt, and upon all the people under their miniſtery as enemies of his Kingdome, and as men to whoſe perſons and infants the very Sacraments and ſeales of grace, with all church-communion, may and ought to be denied (they are their owne
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:158510:63"/>words;) can they therefore expect any reall friendſhip from them, whatſoever outward curteſie they ſeem to ſhew them? no doubtleſſe; how can any poore chriſtian have any delight to come amongſt theſe men, or ſo much as to be in their ſociety, whom they account of as the enemies of Chriſt &amp; his Kingdom? For my owne particular, I would not willingly come in any mans company, or be familiar with any that I thought a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt enemy of Chriſt and his Kingdome, neither ſhould I ever beleeve I could have any reall eſteem from ſuch as think me an enemie of Chriſt and his Kingdome.</p>
            <p>It was the greateſt calamity to the poore ſufferers under the Prelats tyranny, and to all thoſe diſtreſſed chriſtians that were haled into the High-commiſſion court or into the Star-chamber, or before the Counſell table for matter of Religion and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence (which was the lot of many thouſands through the whole Kingdome) that commonly their greateſt enemies were thoſe of their owne houſe; their parents, their brethren and fiſters would be the chiefeſt calumniators &amp; reproachers of them, and that in word and deed would moſt deſpightfully perſecute them, deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them the common humanity of hoſpitality, and would not ſo much as look on them, except it were to revile them and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult over them, and would ordinarily joyne with their enemies both privately and publikely, and deſert them in their greateſt ſtreights, as all of them can generally witneſſe, which not onely encouraged their enemies againſt them, but added credit to their falſe accuſations and calumnies; for they would uſually ſay, ye may ſee what manner of men theſe are, whoſe nigheſt friends are not onely aſhamed of, but thus ſpeake of them; which was a greater affliction unto them than all the other miſeries and ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings they underwent; for had they been their profeſſed ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, they could eaſily have endured it, and there would leſſe credit and regard have been given to their words but they were their parents brethren, ſiſters and familiars and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it added more ſharply to their affliction: So had they been our profeſſed enemies as Papiſts, Socinians, Arminians or thoſe of the Prelaticall faction that ſhould have proclaimed us ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and had they denyed unto us and out children the ſeals of grace, with all church communion, it would not have troubled us, but <hi>tu Brute,</hi> that brethren, that
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:158510:63"/>fellow-ſufferers in affliction, that had gone up to the houſe of God together, and had taken ſweet counſell together; that they ſhould now proclaime us the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and deny communion with us; oh let not this be ſpoken in <hi>Gath</hi> and <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kelon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is that that grieves and fads the hearts of their brethren more then all their former afflictions, and gives a great advantage to the common enemy, and ſcandalizes the Goſpell, and expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes both themſelves and us to the ſcorne of the Malignants, who ordinarily jeere and ſay, ſee thoſe holy Brethren that loſt their cares together, are now together by the eares, and count one of another as a company of Infidels, and diſclaime all holy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion one with another, and will not ſo much as admit of their children to baptiſme, or ſuffer them to receive the Sacraments with them.</p>
            <p>But this is that that makes all men wonder, to hear them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claime all the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to be ſuch as <hi>deny, diſclaime and preach againſt Christs Kingly government,</hi> when it is apparently evident, both by all their preachings and writings, and all their practices, that they ever advance Chriſts Kingly government as really as any of thoſe that oppoſe them, who in preaching up the Kingly office of Chriſt, and ſetting Chriſt upon his Throne, are inferiour to none of them in this work; For we are taught out of Gods Word, that thoſe Miniſters ſet up Chriſt in his Throne, that open the eyes of the blind, and turne them from darkneſſe to light, and from the power of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan to God, that they might receive forgiveneſſe of ſinnes, and an inheritance amongſt them that are ſanctified by faith in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that teach men to repent and turne to God, and doe works meet for repentance; and when the people that heare them give themſelves firſt to the Lord and unto his Miniſters by the will of God, and after denying all ungodlineſſe and worldly luſts, live ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world.</p>

            <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in his <hi>Epistle</hi> to the <hi>Phillippians, chap.</hi> 1. has theſe words, <hi>Some</hi> ſaith he, <hi>preach Chriſt even of envy and ſtrife, and ſome alſo of good will; the one preach Chriſt of contention and not ſincerely, thinking to adde affliction to my bonds, but the other of love: What then? notwithſtanding every way, whether in pretence or in truth Chriſt be preached, I therein doe rejoyce, yea, and I will rejoyce.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeakes here of ſuch as preach pure doctrine, though not with a pure mind and was glad that Chriſt was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, and counts them not the enemies of Chriſt, as he did the falſe teachers among the <hi>Galatians,</hi> who joyned the ceremoniall law and their owne inventions with the Goſpell, and therefore he wiſht that they were cut off; but in this place he rejoyces that Chriſt and the Goſpell were purely preached, though it were of envy.</p>
            <p>Now when the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> doe not onely preach the Goſpell purely, but of ſincerity and of love, and mingle not their owne traditions and inventions with the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, but follow their commiſſion; how can any men without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable injuſtice proclaime them the enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and make them odious to the people under the name of Presbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians whom they perſwade all men that they will prove more cruell Taskmaſters than the Prelates? yea and they have gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally poſſeſt the people with ſo prejudicate an opinion of them all, as if they would more lord it over them than ever the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops did, and cauſeleſly have moved the people to hate the name of presbitry: And notwithſtanding they themſelves pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend they contend for the ancient presbitry, and by this make themſelves Presbiterians as well as the other: What juſtice or equity then is there in their dealing, to make their brethren odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the world for endeavouring to ſet up a Presbitry after
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:158510:65"/>Gods Word, when they themſelves are Presbiterians, and labour to ſet up a Presbitry of their owne? and therefore if the name of Presbiters be odious in the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> no reaſon can gainſay it, but that they alſo ſhould be as odious to the people as their brethren, for they alſo are Presbiterians. But that the truth may the better appear, whether the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> or the Independent Miniſters, be moſt guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the accuſations laid to their charge, it will not be amiſſe to compare the practice of the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the proceedings of the Independent Miniſters together, and that both for their doctrine and diſcipline, and in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſtudies and eudeavours, for the advancing of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; and by ſo doing it will be eaſie for any to judge, which of their governments and which of the Miniſters are more intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, and which of them are moſt guilty of thoſe foule reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> are aſperſed with by their Brethren; for he hath a ſhallow underſtanding and a very dim ſight that cannot diſcerne, whether thoſe that advance Chriſts their Kings Word and lawes onely, and follow his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion and the example of the holy Apoſtles in their miniſtries, and that of <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt and the primitive Preachers, or thoſe that ſet up their owne inventions, and preferre them before the lawes of Chriſt, and have neither precept nor preſident for their doings in all the holy Word of God: He I ſay that cannot judge which of theſe moſt advance Chriſt for their King, either thoſe that obey Chriſts lawes, or thoſe that obſerve their owne, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting Chriſts, is of a very ſhallow capacity.</p>
            <p>But now let us compare them together; the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> preach faith and repentance, the Law and the Goſpell, according to Chriſts commiſſion given to his Apoſtles, and they receive all into the Church that beleeve and are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, and ſuch as but deſire to be admitted, they demanding of them what they ſhould doe to be ſaved; and in their ſo doing, they have both precept and preſidents: For Chriſt in his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto them has given them auhority ſo to doe.</p>
            <p>Neither did he ever ſay unto his Apoſtles and Miniſters, admit none into the church, although they beleeve and are baptized, without they walk with you ſome dayes, weeks, moneths or yeeres, that you may behold their converſation and manner of
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:158510:65"/>life, and after you have had ſome tryall and experience of them ſee then that they make a publike confeſſion of their faith before the Church, and give in the evidences of the truth of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion before the congregation, and enter into a private and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne covenant, and be admitted by the conſent and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Church; or otherwiſe if they will not ſubmit themſelves to this law, and come into the Church upon theſe conditions, receive them not into your aſſemblies, nor admit of them for members.</p>
            <p>Here is nothing of all this in Chriſts commiſſion, nor in his holy Word, nor any preſident of the ſame in all ſacred Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and therefore <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt and the holy Apoſtles and primitive Miniſters admitted all that came unto them, and ſuch as but demanded of them what they ſhould doe to be ſaved; and baptized them and received them into the Church-without any gainſaying or queſtion: as we may ſee in the third of <hi>Lake,</hi> and in the ſeventh chapter of the ſame book, and in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts;</hi> and no ſooner did the Eunuch deſire baptiſme, but <hi>Philip</hi> granted it; the Goaler did but ask <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> What they ſhould doe to be ſaved, and they ſaid, <hi>Beleeve on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt and thou ſhalt be ſaved and thy houſe;</hi> and it is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that the Goaler and all his were ſtreightway baptized, <hi>Acts</hi> 16. <hi>ver.</hi> 31, 32, 33. that is, they were forthwith admitted into the Church, without either walking any time with the Church for their approbation, or without either making a publike con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of their faith before the Church, or giving in evidences of the truth of their converſion to the congregation, or entring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a private covenant, and without the conſent and allowance of the Church.</p>
            <p>And Chriſt notwithſtanding was imbraced by them as their Lord and King, and was preached by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas,</hi> as the Lord and King of his Church, and was ſet up upon his Throne as King by them, as well as he is in any independent Churches and yet they had none of all their new borne truths, and they could then ſee how to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne without their new lights; and as Chriſt was then by <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> and the other Apoſtles ſet upon his Throne as King in all thoſe primitive Churches, ſo he is at this day in all the true Proteſtant Churches through the world, as well as in any of the Independent Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:158510:66"/>and yet they were and are all ignorant of their new way; ſo that any underſtanding chriſtian may gather, that all their new borne truths are no way requiſite for the ſetting up of Chriſt as King in his Church, nor for the advancement of Chriſts Kingly government; for if they had, Chriſt would have put them into the Apoſtles commiſſion, and the Apoſtles who were led into all truth by the holy Thoſt, who brought whatſoever Chriſt had taught them concerning the Kingdome of God (<hi>Acts</hi> 1.) into their memories, would have ſuggeſted all theſe things, <hi>The new way, the new borne truth, the new lights</hi> to them, that they might have been recorded, if they had been neceſſary for the ſetting up of Chriſt upon his Throne; but when neither Chriſt nor the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, nor the bleſſed Apoſtles have preſcribed any of all theſe to the church, nor called for them, nor required them of any that deſire to be ſaved or made members of the church; whether this be not a great temerity in any men, to preach all theſe things as the lawes of Chriſt, I leave it to the judgement of any ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous minded chriſtian? and whether this be not to preferre their owne inventions and traditions before the commandements of God and the lawes of Chriſt the King of his church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not rather to ſet up themſelves than Chriſt? I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre it alſo to any judicious and impartiall chriſtian to weigh and conſider.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now demand of any moderate chriſtian therefore, and let him anſwer me candidly, whether of thoſe Miniſters and people moſt advance the Kingdome of Chriſt, and acknowledge him to be their onely Lord and Law-giver, that both in their teaching and beleeving follow his commiſſion and Word, and teach nothing nor beleeve nothing (as they are injoyned) but what Chriſt their King commands them? or thoſe, that to the commiſſion and commands of Chriſt adde their owne inventions and traditions, and preferre them before the lawes of Chriſt the King and Law-giver of his church? I am confident, if he will deale impartially, he will anſwer me, that thoſe Miniſters and that people moſt advance Chriſt for their King, and moſt ſet him upon his Throne, that owne his law, and that onely for the rule of their faith and obedience; for Chriſt himſelfe hath ſaid it, <hi>John</hi> 10. <hi>My Sheep heare my voyce,</hi> they will not liſten unto the voyce of a ſtranger; Chriſts voyce onely the King of his
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:158510:66"/>church is to be heard, and they onely that obey it advance him for their King and ſet him up on his Throne, which when the Miniſters and beleevers in the church of <hi>England</hi> doe, and the Independents doe not, they more advance Chriſt for their King than they; for the Independents to Chriſts law and commiſſion adde their owne traditions and inventions, and enjoyne all that will be admitted as members into their congregations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their beleeving &amp; being baptized, to walk with them ſome time for approbation, and to make a publike confeſſion of their faith before the church, and to bring in the evidences of the truth of their converſion, and enter into a private and ſolemne covenant, and not to be admitted as members without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Church, all which Chriſt the King of his church never commanded, and thoſe that will not ſubmit themſelves to theſe their traditions, they will not permit or ſuffer to enter into their church as joyned members, which they call the onely true churches of Chriſt, and count of all others that differ from them as enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and as men without the covenant: and if this be to ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, then the Phariſees ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, who preferred their own traditions before the commandments of God; yea, the pope himſelf &amp; the Prelats ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, who prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their own traditions and idolatries before the lawes of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Now if all the traditions of the Papiſts were juſtly abhorred and caſt out of the church as things derogatory to the Kingly and Propheticall dignity of Jeſus Chriſt, and as things repugnant to his royalty; I ſee no reaſon but all other popery under whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver name or title it be intruded upon, the people ſhould be eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated and caſt out of the church; and whether this be not a new kind of popery, to bring in new wayes, and new borne truths, and new lights, and impoſe them upon the people as the commands of God, and to excommunicate and unchurch all churches in the world but their owne aſſemblies, I referre my ſelfe to the judgement of any intelligible chriſtian? Saint <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the <hi>Galatians,</hi> blames thoſe falſe teachers amongſt them, that would have joyned but the ceremoniall law with the Goſpell, &amp; cals it a perverting of the Goſpell of Chriſt, &amp; wiſhes that ſuch teachers were cut off, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>v.</hi> 12. and blames likewiſe thoſe <hi>Galatians</hi> that received their doctrine, ſaying, <hi>Oh fooliſh
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:158510:67"/>Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you ſhould not obey the truth;</hi> and yet they onely urged the ceremoniall law which God by <hi>Moſes</hi> had appointed to remaine till the fulneſſe of time, but was now abrogated; they were not their owne traditions, they were no new borne lights, no new wayes, no new truths.</p>
            <p>Now if <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo diſpleaſed, or God rather with the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> both teachers and hearers, the one for bringing in or joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ceremoniall law to the Goſpell, and the other for admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, how highly would God have been diſpleaſed with them if they had ſet up their owne inventions for the lawes of God, and had brought in new borne truths, and intruded them upon the people as neceſſary to ſalvation, and for the ſetting up of Chriſt upon his Throne? Without doubt the Apoſtle would moſt ſharply have reproved them, and have given ſpeciall cave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ats againſt them, as he did in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>chapter</hi> of the which, being chiefly ſpent in condemning all humane traditions; yea, in his firſt <hi>chapter</hi> of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians, ver.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>He chargeth them, that though the Apostles themſelves, or an Angel from Heaven ſhould preach unto them otherwiſe than that they had received, they ſhould count him ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſed; and as I ſaid before,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>ſo ſay I now againe, if any man preach unto you otherwiſe than that you have received, let him be accurſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But none of the Apoſtles ever taught the Church, that chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and beleevers, though baptized, ſhould not be admitted as members into the church, unleſſe they had walked ſome time in church-fellowſhip with them, and had firſt made a publike confeſſion of their faith, and had brought in the evidences of the truth of their converſion, and entred into a ſolemne private co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, and were admitted by the conſent of the church, none of all this did ever the Apoſtles teach, or the chriſtians of thoſe times embrace or beleeve, and therefore ſuch doctrines as theſe ought not to be received.</p>
            <p>In the firſt of the <hi>Corinthians</hi> in many places he reproves thoſe that made ſciſmes and brought in hereſies and ſects into the church; and in the fourth <hi>chapter</hi> and ſixt <hi>verſe,</hi> under his owne and <hi>Apollo's</hi> name, he ſets an example before them, that they ſhould containe themſelves with in the limits and bounds of that doctrine and manner of preaching, preſcribed and ſet downe in
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:158510:67"/>the Word of God, and uſed by the Spirit of God; and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them that they ſhould learne in the Apoſtles, not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume or to be wiſe above that which is written, and enjoynes all chriſtians to reject all wayes of teaching that have not Gods Word for their warrant: Now in all Gods Word there is nothing of all this written, that after men beleeve and are baptized, they ſhould not yet be admitted into the church, without they had walked ſometime with them for their approbation, and without they had made a publike confeſſion of their faith before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and brought in the evidences of their true converſion, and had entred into a private covenant, and were admitted by the conſent of the church; none of all this is written in Gods Word, and therefore we ought not to embrace it.</p>
            <p>And in the ſecond of the <hi>Corinths, chap.</hi> 11. <hi>ver.</hi> 4. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſignifieth unto the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that no man can teach the Goſpel more exactly tahn he and the other Apoſtles have taught them, nor ſet before them a more perfect doctrine of Jeſus Chriſt than that that they have taught them, for the converting of any unto Chriſt, and for the ſetting up of Chriſt as King upon his Throne and for the making of them members of the church, and for the building of them up in their moſt holy faith, and commands the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to take heed of all falſe teachers, whatſoever piety and godlineſſe they make ſhew of, calling them <hi>deceitfull workers, &amp; ſuch as transforme themſelves into the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles of Chriſt: And no mervaile,</hi> ſaith he <hi>for Satan himſelfe can transforme himſelfe into an Angel of light; and therefore it is no wonder his ministers transforme themſelves, as though they were the ministers of righteouſneſſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if men will conſider what thoſe falſe teachers were, we ſhall find them to be no other, but ſuch as under ſhew of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and piety taught their owne inventions and grolleryes, and abuſed the ſimplicity of the people for their owne advantage, and brought them into bondage and devoured them, <hi>verſe</hi> 20. as the Phariſes did the Widowes houſes, under pretence of their long prayers, which our Saviour Chriſt ſharply reproves them for and denounces a woe againſt them for their ſo doing; after the ſame manner did theſe falſ teachers amongſt the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> who made their owne traditions joyned members with the Goſpel, as if they had had a more fine, neat and eliganter way of gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:158510:68"/>of Churches and admitting of members than <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles: But the Apoſtle bids the <hi>Corinthians</hi> take heed of all ſuch, how glorious ſoever they ſeem to appeare, and tels them they cannot teach the way to Heaven and happineſſe better than he and the other Apoſtles have done; and yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Saint <hi>Paul</hi> or any of the Apoſtles in preaching of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, taught them that they ſhould admit of none to be joyned members of the Church, although they beleeved and were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized, except they walked ſome time in fellowſhip amongſt them, that they might have approbation and tryall of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation firſt, and after make a publike confeſſion of their faith before the church, and did give in evidences of the truth of their converſion to the congregation, and entred into a ſolemne pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate covenant, and were admitted members by conſent of the church.</p>
            <p>Not a word of all this in the Goſpel that Saint <hi>Paul</hi> and the other Apoſtles taught, and therefore all that teach their new wayes, their new-borne truths, and ſet up their new lights, are wiſe above that which is written, and teach otherwiſe than Chriſt and his Apoſtles have taught, or the chriſtians of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times had received, and therefore ought by the Apoſtles command, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9. to be accurſed. Saint <hi>John</hi> alſo in his ſecond Epiſtle to the Elect Lady, <hi>ver.</hi> 9, 10. ſaith, <hi>Who ſoever tranſgreſſeth and abideth not in the doctrine of Chriſt, hath not God; he that continueth in the doctrine of Chriſt he hath both the Father and the Son: If there come any unto you that bringeth not the doctrine of Chriſt, receive him not into your houſe, neither bid him God ſpeed; for he that biddeth him God ſpeed, is a partaker of his evill deeds.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now the doctrine that the Independent Miniſters teach for the gathering of Churches and admitting of members, and joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and jumbling of them together, was never taught by Chriſt nor any of his Apoſtles, for they themſelves confeſſe it is a new way, and a new-borne truth, and a new light, and therefore not the doctrine of Chriſt, and therefore ſuch novelties are not to be entertained nor imbraced, nor the teachers of them, if we will be obedient to Apoſtolicall precepts: I deſire therefore thoſe of the Independent brethren to produce any one teſtimony, or any one preſident out of the Word of God, where theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:158510:68"/>are taught or have been practiced. Firſt; that although men and women beleeve and are baptized, they are not yet to be admitted as joyned members till they have walked ſome time in fellowſhip with the church for approbation of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; this is the firſt thing; I deſire of the brethren either a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept or an example for this in Gods Word. The ſecond, where it is commanded that thoſe that beleeve and are baptized ſhould not be admitted as members of the church, without a publike confeſſion of their faith before the church. The third, where it is enjoyned, that to their faith and baptiſme, they ſhould bring in the evidences of the truth of their converſion before they can be capable of their memberſhip. The fourth, where it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded that they ſhould enter into a ſolemne and private cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant before they can be admitted to Church-fellowſhip. The fifth, where it is impoſed upon thoſe that beleeve and are bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, that they ſhould not be received into the church without the conſent of the congregation. Sixthly, where it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhall run about from their own places and charges into the ſheepfolds of their fellow-ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heards, and ſeparate and pick out all their beſt ſheep and bring them into their owne folds, and debarre them from all church-fellowſhip and communicating with the other beleevers in Gods holy Ordinances and Sacraments; or where ever it is command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that the preachers of the goſpel ſhall gather beleeving chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans from amongſt beleeving chriſtians &amp; ſeparate them from the other ſheep, into Independent congregations, and ſhall proclaim all that are not thus molded up after this new modell, to be people out of covenant, and to have no right to the ſeales of the new covenant, neither they nor their children, though be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
            <p>All theſe things I deſire the brethren by evident places of the holy Scripture to make good and to confirme, or by any preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or example to declare to have been practiced either by Chriſt or his bleſſed Apoſtles; for I looke for a law from Chriſt the King of his church, who was as faithful in the houſe of God as <hi>Moſes</hi> was, and hath not left the ordering and diſpoſing of his church to the will of men, but has commanded the church to heare his voyce, who is the great Paſtor and Biſhop of our ſouls, and the teacher of his church; his Word therefore I look for,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:158510:69"/>for a warrant for the ratifying of all theſe doctrines; and I have good ground and reaſon to demand of them a warrant and authority out of Gods Word for what they both teach and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; for we are taught by Chriſt the onely Prophet of his church, that they that ſerve God after the precepts of men, offer him a vaine worſhip: and it ſtands with all good reaſon, that if all humane traditions, though of never ſo ancient ſtanding, and of never ſo long antiquity were all caſt out of the church, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had no footing or ground in Gods Word, that all no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties or new inventions of men (which notwithſtanding are impoſed upon the people as the wayes of God) ſhould be abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and nullified and caſt out of the church.</p>
            <p>It is recorded in holy writ, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 9. that the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>Joſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> under pretence that they came from a farre country, and for proofe of that they produced their mouldy bread, and their tattered boots &amp; their old ſhooes, and they taking what they ſaid, <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and not conſulting with the mouth of the Lord (as it is fully related in that <hi>chapter</hi>) were deceived by them, and entred into a League with their enemies: And thus the Papiſts and Prelats, for theſe many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeers, have deluded the world, under pretence of their mouldy antiquities &amp; tattered ragges of traditions, and in all this time they prevailed to miſlead the poore people, becauſe they conſulted not with the mouth of God, nor examined things by the Word of God and the holy Scripture, as the noble <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> did.</p>
            <p>Now whatſoever was written, was written for our inſtruction, upon whom the ends of the world are come; and therefore as it was the errour of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that they received things barely upon report, without conſulting with the mouth of God; and as it was the honour and praiſe of thoſe noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> that they ſearched the Scriptures to ſee whether the preaching of <hi>Paul</hi> were according to the holy Scripture: ſo if we ſhall receive theſe new borne truths, theſe new lights, theſe new wayes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſulting with the living Oracles, we ſhall offend as the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> did in beleeving the <hi>Gibeonites</hi> upon their words, and ſhall degenerate and be unlike to thoſe the renowned <hi>Bereans,</hi> who would not receive <hi>Paul's</hi> doctrine, though an Apoſtle, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſearching the Scriptures, whether things were ſo or no, as he
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:158510:69"/>taught them: and ſurely now much more ought we to try all things by the Word in theſe erroneous times; whoſoever they be that preach them unto us, and if they be not evidently proved unto us out of the Scriptures, we may not admit of them, for it will be not onely a ſinne, but for our immortall ſhame, to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded with novelties, much more than it was our anceſtors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace to be deceived by pretended antiquities.</p>
            <p>And therefore it is the duty of every chriſtian ſeriouſly to conſider with themſelves, that theſe are matters of God, and concerne no leſſe than our eternall welfare; and in that regard, we may not call mens wayes, Gods wayes but we are to ſeek for the old wayes, <hi>Jer.</hi> 6. we are to examine Chriſts and his holy Apoſtles wayes in gathering of churches and making of mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and if we find no footſtep in all Gods Word of theſe new wayes, we ought to relinquiſh them and turne againe into the pathes that God has commanded us to walk in, wherein we ſhall be ſure to find reſt for our ſoules and comfort in life and death and it will be no diſgrace to any to be undeceived; for they are deceived, and that, greatly and dangerouſly, that thinke or beleeve, that any men mortall can ſhew or teach a better way to Heaven, or ſet downe a better way of converting ſoules and of gathering of churches and making of members and of ſetting up Chriſt as King upon his Throne, than that which Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe and his bleſſed Apoſtles have taught and ſet downe to all poſterity; and from the which rule we ought not to ſwerve, though an Angel from Heaven ſhould teach us otherwiſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. <hi>ver.</hi> 8, 9.</p>
            <p>When therefore the Miniſters of the church of <hi>England</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſts and his Apoſtles way and method in their teaching and for the converting of men, and heare onely the voyce of Chriſt their King, and the chriſtian beleevers through the Kngdome under their miniſtries, doe all faithfully cleave unto the written Word and ſquare both their faith and obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that rule; there is no juſt cauſe why the Independents ſhould proclaime them all enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and ſuch as oppoſe his royalty; and preach up themſelves and their congregations as the onely people of God and his Saints, and account all thoſe that diſſent from them as oppoſers of Chriſts government, telling the people in their Sermons, that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:158510:70"/>they come over from beyond the ſeas, thinking that they would have ſet up Chriſt upon his Throne, and that they would have embraced him for their King, and would have eſtabliſhed his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and have gone on in a church-way, and have ſet up the wayes of God; but they find it otherwiſe, that they deny and diſclaime and preach againſt Chriſts Kingly government, and perſecute the wayes of the Lord Chriſt; ſo that they can find more favour from moderate Papiſts and common Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants than from them, by which their dealing, ſay the brethren, they have ſo taken off the edge of Gods peoples affection from them, that the Saints and ſervants of God cannot pray for them, proclaiming themſelves the Saints and people of God, as if all the other beleevers through the Kingdome diſſenting from them, in their opinions were no Saints nor people of God.</p>
            <p>Nay, they affirme it in their Pulpits and in every Pamphlet, that both Miniſters and people are enemies of Jeſus Chriſt and his Kingdome, and all ſuch as will not joyne with them in their new wayes: And one of them not long ſince affirmed unto me, that the church of <hi>England</hi> was a Strumpet &amp; an arrant Whore, and that ſhee being once a Whore, could never be preſented un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt as a chaſte Spouſe: which was an expreſſion not onely uncivill and unbeſeeming a chriſtian, but untrue alſo; for grant ſhee had been ſo, ſhee is now come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> and has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a publike covenant againſt her; and we read of <hi>Juda</hi> and <hi>Samaria,</hi> howſoever they had defiled themſelves and played the Harlots, yet upon their unfained repentance and true faith in Jeſus Chriſt and renewing their covenant publikely of new obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, were preſented unto Chriſt as a chaſte Spouſe, ſo that what is impoſſible with man is poſſible with God.</p>
            <p>But this is the generall opinion of the brethren. and howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they will not all of them ſpeak it out in plaine words, as ſome of them doe, yet they preach and practice a ſeparation from all our aſſemblies and congregations, as from a people not to be communicated with, and declare that by their deedes, which they will not as yet publiſh in their writings, nor expreſſe words as he did.</p>
            <p>And one of the Independent Miniſters not long ſince, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing Gods judgements againſt all thoſe that would not aſſent unto their new wayes, nor light their candles at their new
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:158510:70"/>lights, nor embrace their new-borne truths, told them, that by their ſtanding out againſt the wayes of God (for ſo they ſuppoſe theſe are) and by their unkind uſage of the Saints, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them, they would at laſt drive from amongſt them the praying people (meaning themſelves, as if no other prayed but they onely) and then they might look that the judgements of God would ſpeedily come downe upon them, as it happened to the <hi>Lutherans</hi> in <hi>Maydenburge</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who thruſt out all the Calvaniſts out of their Towne, a praying people, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly after, the enemy came upon them with fire and ſword and deſtroyed them all.</p>
            <p>With theſe and ſuch like expreſſions are their preachments ſtuffed, and to ſay the truth of many of their Sermons, they are like Taylors cuſhions, conſiſting of a hundred ſeverall ſhreds of various colours, all independent, making a fine ſhew, but comely no where but in a Taylors ſhop: and ſurely ſuch kind of expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons as theſe are may beſeem their Pulpits, but no grave and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned honeſt mens; for they have no juſt cauſe to complaine of perſecution amongſt us, it is a calumny; neither deale they chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianly with us, to accuſe us that we oppoſe the wayes of God, for we doe not ſo; we onely contend for the faith once delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the Saints, and againſt the wayes of men, and ſuch as were brought into the Church by the cunning craftineſſe of ſome, and thruſt upon the people as the Lawes and Ordinances and wayes of God, when they are but their owne inventions, and tend to no edification, but to the trouble and diſturbance of Church and State, and ſuch as already have brought a confuſion upon us all, and if the Lord doth not ſpeedily from Heaven ſend his helping hand, we can expect nothing but deſolation, and all from theſe deviſions that their new wayes have brought in, and therefore it is high time for all good chriſtians and ſuch as love the peace of <hi>Sion,</hi> more exactly to examine all theſe new wayes; and to put them upon the proofe of them.</p>
            <p>But that the brethren ſhould complain of perſecution amongſt us, and of evill uſage, it is againſt all reaſon and humanity, and ſheweth little gratitude in them to all the chriſtians both thorow city and country; for if they remember when they came over, though they had deſerted the cauſe when they had moſt need of them, they were more honoured then any of thoſe famous and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:158510:71"/>learned Miniſters that had undergone the labour and heat of the day, and they were preferred before them all, and ſetled in the prime Lectures of the Kingdome, and had more honourable maintainance than was uſually given to any Lectures before them; and therefore they deale not brotherly in none of all their proceedings, nor humanely ſo to aſperſe them as they ordinarily doe both publikely and privately.</p>
            <p>I am confident there is not ſuch a preſident in the world of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity as that ſhewed here to them; it is well known, and their books and practices declare it, that they preach new wayes, new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne truthes, and ſet up new lights: Now where was it ever heard of either in the Chriſtian or Pagan world, that it was ever permitted unto any Miniſters or Preachers to have all the Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits in any nation to preach a divers doctrine, to that which is ſet up by authority, and ſuch as tends to make a faction and deviſion amongſt the people? I doe moſt aſſuredly beleeve that there cannot the like preſident be produced.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Heathen, the Jewiſh Religion in many coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries was tolerated; but they were confined to their owne Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogues, they might not come in the Heathens Pulpits to preach up the Jewiſh worſhip amongſt them or to ſet up another ſervice contrary to the cuſtome of the Nation: It was an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Egyptians that the Jewes ſhould ſacrifice in their land, they would not have ſuffered them then to have prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched up their Religion in all their Pulpits.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Turkey</hi> at this day Chriſtians in many places have the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their conſciences amongſt themſelves, and have their places for worſhip to aſſemble in; but they are not ſo much as permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to come into their Temples, much leſſe to preach up their Religion in their Pulpits.</p>
            <p>In <hi>France</hi> the Proteſtants are permitted to preach, but it is one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in ſuch places as are appointed for them, they may not preach in popiſh Pulpits, that is not permitted unto them.</p>
            <p>In the Low countries there is liberty of conſcience, which they ſo much plead for (of which afterwards) and yet the divers ſects that are there, are not ſuffered to preach out of thoſe places aſſigned unto them, or to preach publikely in any of their Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pits againſt the Religion eſtabliſhed by authority, neither are they permitted to unchriſtian them or unchurch them, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:158510:71"/>and in print to proclaime them enemies, of Chriſts go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; and if any ſhould dare attempt ſuch a thing, or goe about to diſgrace their Miniſters and church-government, or in the leaſt intrench upon the Mrgiſtrates authority, they would be made fly like lightning before thunder.</p>
            <p>And yet the brethren among us have the liberty of all the Pulpits through the Kingdome without controle, and vent all their new wayes and their new-borne truths, and ſet up their new lights without any moleſtation, and have all reſpectfull uſage and the onely eſteem of the people, and are more followed than all our learned, godly and painfull orthodox Miniſters, and yet they cry out of perſecution, and unchurch and unchriſtian us all, and proclaime both Miniſters and people all enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and count of us little better than of Infidels, and keep our children from baptiſme, and debarre us from com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, and exerciſe a kind of abſolute lordſhip over all their brethren, ſo as <hi>Deotraphes</hi> never did the like, nor the Pope more, and yet they cry out of perſecution againſt the Saints, and lay odious aſperſions upon their brethren and fellow-Presbiters, perſwading the people that the presbiterian way will be as bad or worſe than that of the Prelats.</p>
            <p>But if we as duly examine the manner of the Independent go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and compare it with the Presbiterian, as we have done the manner of their preaching with theirs, we ſhall find there is little reaſon why they ſhould ſo villipend the Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian and magnifie their owne, and why they ſhould make it ſo hatefull and odious to the people; laying aſide therefore all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice, let us examine things with deliberation, and then it will be ſoon evident, that the Presbiterian government is not as bad or worſe than that of the Prelats, nor ſo lordly as that of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent government which is alſo Presbyterian, and they as well Presbyters as their brethren.</p>
            <p>It is well knowne that the Prelats aſſumed and arrogated unto themſelves to be the onely Paſtors of their Dioceſſes, and ruled all the Miniſters and people under them by their owne authority and ſpoyled all both Minſters and people, and the ſeverall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations under them of their liberty, and made them all both Miniſters and people their vaſſals and ſlaves, and from whoſe Courts there was no appeale: Whereas the Presbiterian manner
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:158510:72"/>of government is not as that of Lords and Maſters over Subjects and Servants, but ſociall as between equals, between brethren, friends and colledges, who all judge and are all judged according to the Word of God, where no congregation is above another congregation, no Miniſter is above another Miniſter, but onely for order-ſake, where every Presbiter is left to enjoy the whole office of a Presbiter, and each congregation to the freedome of a congregation, &amp; what belongs unto them, and they able to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme it, and the claſſes to corroborate and ſtrengthen them.</p>
            <p>And if any man be wronged by the Presbitry, he may have the benefit of his appeale, and be cleered by more righteous Judges (a courſe ever followed by the Churches, and agreeable to the light of nature) ſo that I ſay, if men would without a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate opinion weigh and conſider all things, and compare the government of the Prelats with that of the Presbiterian, they would ſpeedily be undeceived. And againe, if they would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the Presbiterian government dependent with the Presbite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian government independent, they would have more honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable thoughts of the one and a leſſe eſteem of the other; for in the Presbiterian government independent, they exerciſe a kind of abſolute power and ſoveraignty amongſt themſelves in every of their ſeverall Churches or congregations; ſo that if two or three of the Presbiters be malicious or ſelf-will'd, or corrupt or hereticall, as it happens many times, and by their learning or eloquence or great abilities of wit and ſchollerſhip, or by their wealth or power, the congregation perhaps conſiſting of many poore people, and it may be ignorant, who are relieved by them, and whoſe favour they dare not forfeit, if they prevailing with the major part of the congregation (as commonly the poore peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are like a company of wild Geeſ, who which way ſoever their leader flyes they all follow) I ſay, if they do once deliver a man to ſatan, and will not by any art of perſwaſion be induced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe their unrighteous ſentence, the innocent and wronged man muſt live under this doome all the dayes of his life without any remedy, and muſt be held by all the Churches of Chriſt (that are after that new modell) to whom their ſentence is given notice of as an excommunicated perſon and ſhun'd accordingly, they have no power to abſolve or help him, and from which he hath no benefit of appeale.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:158510:72"/>
            <p>And this that I now ſpeake, there is not any of the brethren that is well verſt in the grounds of that kind of government, that either will or can deny it: And this rigor to my knowledge, both in the low Countries in the ſeverall congregations of the Engliſh there, and in ſome here in <hi>England</hi> among us was the cauſe of making ſo many ſeverall ſects; for when they were caſt out of one congregation, for ſome particular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, in the which they differed from them, the other churches and congregations of the ſame mould and profeſſion could not abſolve them, nor durſt not receive them into church fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with them, without an atteſtation from the church, out of which they were excommunicated of their chriſtian walking amongſt them, or had given ſatisfaction to that church of which they had been members, and that they would never be brought unto conceiving that the wrong was theirs, who complained as unjuſtly excommunicated, neither would they relinquiſh their opinion, as being perſwaded it was grounded upon the Word of God; whereupon they finding others of their owne opinion joyned themſelves into a new ſociety and congregation, and had a peculiar church by themſelves, and this has been one of the chiefeſt cauſes of all theſe rents and deviſions we now ſee every where; for when they are upon every ſlight occaſion, or for any difference in opinion caſt out then they congregate a new church by themſelves, and turne Paſtors.</p>
            <p>The which, bleſſed be God, in the reformed churches of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany,</hi> hath not yet been ſeen ſince the firſt reformation; for the governing of Churches by the Common-counſell of their Presbiters, where they find ſuch brotherly dealing, and where they have their appeals upon any conceived wrong or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, and have right and juſtice done them, makes them willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit themſelves to that manner of government, without making rents and ſciſmes: And truly, if things were but mature<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weighed, all men would readily perceive that there is no juſt ground of reproach to be laid upon the Presbiters, neither would they ſee any reaſon, why, in way of diſdaine, the Miniſters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſhould be more called Presbiterians than the Independent Miniſters; for they alſo are Presbiterians, and labour to ſet up a presbiterian government as well as the other,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:158510:73"/>and profeſſe in their writings that they contend for the ancient presbitry, ſo that they alſo are presbiterians as well as the other; and if the one be made hatefull and formidable to the people, in the judgement of all ſolid men, the other alſo may be made as odious and hatefull; for if that odium and hatred they bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the presbitry, be for the onely feare, they have conceived the Presbiters will lord it too much over them, and that onely I ſay, be the occaſion that ſo terrifies the people from that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; let all men here conſider and compare each kind of pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitry together, both that of the Dependent and that of the Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent; for if the Independent Presbiters in the infancy and very firſt beginning and riſe of their government aſſume unto every ſeverall congregation and presbitry of theirs, an abſolute kind of ſoveraignty and juriſdiction from which there is no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale, and if they already take upon them to unchurch all Churches but their owne, and proclaime all the Miniſters and people, but thoſe of their owne congregations, profeſt enemies of Chriſts Kingdome; what would they doe if they were once eſtabliſhed by authority in their ſeverall Juriſdictions and Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies? and if now they will admit of none into their ſeverall Aſſemblies, though never ſo eminent beleevers, but upon their owne conditions, and unleſſe they will be admitted members upon ſuch tearmes as they propound, without either precept or preſident out of the Word of God for their ſo doing (which is the greateſt tyranny of the world) how would theſe men lord it if their government were once eſtabliſhed by Parliament? It is well knowne and can ſufficiently be proved, that godly chriſtians and people of approved integrity and of holy converſation, againſt whom they had no exception either for doctrine or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and who offered themſelves to be admitted members upon their owne conditions, and yet were not ſuffered to be joyned members, onely becauſe they were poore; and this very reaſon was given unto them for their not admiſſion, that they would not have their Church over butdened with poore.</p>
            <p>And others deſiring that their Children might be baptized in their Congregations, and going to the Miniſters of thoſe Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies to entreat this favour, that their children might be baptized among them. For anſwer, it was told them; that they could baptize none but ſuch as were infants of their joyned members (which is
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:158510:73"/>their practice) and wiſhed them firſt to be made joyned mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in one of their Churches: Whereupon they thought that there was no congregation fitter for them to joyne to, than to that Paſtors Aſſembly that had given them this counſell, and therefore applyed themſelves unto him, and deſired that they might be admitted joyned members: for anſwer, it was replyed, that the congregation of which he was Paſtor, conſiſted of great perſonages, Knights, Ladies and rich Merchants, and ſuch people as they being but poore, could not walk ſo ſuitably with them; withall he ſaid, he could doe nothing without the conſent of the Congregation, wherefore he perſwaded them to joyne them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſome other Congregation among poore people, where they might better walk, and more comfortably in fellowſhip with them, ſo that the laſt news I heard of this buſineſſe, was that the children were neither baptized nor the poore men admitted to be joynt members of that Congregation.</p>
            <p>What their Miniſters have done ſince I know not, but I well perceive, it is as great a difficulty for a poore man to get into ſome of their Congregations, as to get into <hi>Suttons-Hospitall;</hi> and that I conceive to be the onely occaſion that makes ſome walk ſo long in many Congregations before they come to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted members, for if they be rich they are ſpeedily received, nay invited to be members.</p>
            <p>It is too well knowne, that many godly and holy people have left their native country, and tranſporttd themſelves over into <hi>New-England,</hi> where this government is ſet up, onely that they might enjoy the Ordinances there in their purity, they were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers before they went, and were baptized, and ſuch as were knowne before they went thither to be the deare ſervants of God; but when they came there (eſpecially if they be poore) they make them walk ſome a yeer, ſome more, yea, ſome ſix or ſeven before they can be admitted members of their Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and they baptize none of thoſe children that are borne there before their parents be joyned members; and except they will in all things conforme themſelves to their own conditions, they ſhall never be admitted.</p>
            <p>And ſometime the man onely is admitted and his wife left out ſtill to walk, and ſometime the wife is admitted and the man
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:158510:74"/>left out ſtill to walk, and both theſe notwithſtanding are belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and baptized; and after with a great deale of difficulty, they are admitted to be members, a very ſmall offence will be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to caſt them out againe, if they be poore. But for ſtories of this nature, I doe not love to multiply them; but I have heard many of this kind from thoſe places, and from ſuch as have been in <hi>New-England,</hi> and men both then and now no way evilly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected either to the place or people, ſerving God there.</p>
            <p>But it is too notorious, they lord it there over Gods poore Clergies in the ſuperlative degree, and every man that has but eyes in his head may ſee it here in <hi>England</hi> in their congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, what difference they make between the rich and poore, and that they have the faith, of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, a ſinne in Saint <hi>James</hi> his time highly blamed in chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>James</hi> 2. and as in their carriage towards the poore, they are very lofty, and look for great obſervance and attendance from them whereſoever they come, ſo likewiſe a little thing will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe them, if they ſpeak a word amiſſe, it is enough to be caſt out of the Congregation; preſidents of this nature might be brought many: And if all this be not to lord it over Gods Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, I know not what it is; to admit of none, though beleevers, and already baptized, but ſuch as will come in upon their owne tearmes, and keep out the poore either altogether, or as long as pleaſeth them, without any other reaſon but becauſe they are poore, and caſt them out againe upon every ſlender occaſion; I ſay, if all this be not a moſt diabolicall tyranny &amp; lording it over Gods Clergies, I referre it to any moderate man to judge of; and if to unchurch all churches but their owne, and at one blaſt to proclaime them all enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, and to deny all church-fellowſhip with them, be not more than a Diotrephian, prelaticall and papall authority there was never any in the world, and if this be not to lord it over Gods Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, there was never any knowne.</p>
            <p>Now I ſay, if the Independent Presbiters doe ſo timely begin their abſolute lording of it, what would they doe if their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were eſtabliſhed by authority? Their miniſtry and government is farre different from that of Chriſt and his holy Prophets and Apoſtles, for they invited all the poore to come in
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:158510:74"/>and to buy milk, yea, to come in and buy milk without mony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. and Saint <hi>Paul</hi> for the encouraging the poore to come in, ſaith, not many mighty not many noble, but the meane and contemptible things hath the Lord made choyce of; inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating unto the poore, that they have as good right to Heaven as the greateſt and chiefeſt; and our Saviour Chriſt ſaith, <hi>come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your ſoules:</hi> Our Saviour has no reſpect of perſons, but the poore are with him as acceptable as the rich, if they be weary and heavy laden with their ſinnes; for that is all the condition that Chriſt requires, in all that deſire to be admitted members of his Church.</p>
            <p>Now when theſe Presbiters already make ſo great difference between the poore and the rich, and between beleevers and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, as they will admit none but at their owne times, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own conditions, I do conceive that this is a moſt tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nically lording it over Gods Clergies and inheritance; which when they daily doe it, and the Presbiters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> doe it not, it is moſt apparent that their rule and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination is more prelaticall and more to be feared than that of the Presbiters of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> for from the indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Presbiters they can never expect any appeale for reliefe and redreſſe, whatſoever wrong or injury they have ſuſtained by them; and therefore there is no juſt cauſe why any ſhould ſo traduce the Presbitry of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as to think they will lord it over the people, from whom they may ever expect farre better meaſure than ever they can from the independent Presbitry, which if it ſhould once be eſtabliſhed, would tend to nothing elſe but to enſlave the whole Kingdome, and to bring in a confuſion upon both Church and State.</p>
            <p>But now it will not be amiſſe before the concluſion, as we have compared the Presbiters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> with the Presbiters independent, both in regard of their doctrine and diſcipline; ſo now likewiſe here to paragonate them together, in their proceedings for the advancement of Chriſts Kingdome, that all men may ſee in that regard alſo, which of their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours tend moſt to the advancement of the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt, and which of them ought to be preferred before other,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:158510:75"/>and which of them doth more really and truly tend not onely to Gods glory but to the peace alſo of the Church and State: For the Presbiters of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> they labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, as there is but one body, one ſpirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptiſme, one God and Father over all, who is above all, and through all, and one true chriſtian Religion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. ſo that this only may be eſtabliſhed, through the three King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes; and that all erronious wayes of worſhipping and ſerving God, and that tends to lead men to perdition, and make diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance in Church and State, may not publikely be tolerated: The Independents on the contary, both publikely and privately, and in all their bitter railing and intolerable pamphlets, as that of the <hi>compaſſionate Samaritan,</hi> the <hi>ſtorming of Antichriſt,</hi> and that of the <hi>arraignment of perſecution,</hi> and in many more of their ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous writings, plead for a toleration of all Religions (under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of liberty of conſcience) whatſoever they be, as Judia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nſme, Turciſme, Popery, Paganiſme, and all manner of ſects, and for the confirming of this their diabolicall tenent, they bring in the example of the heathen Nations, who ſuffered all Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons amongſt them; and the example of <hi>Poland, Tranſſilvania</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> thoſe pantheons of all Religions, and tell us of the Parable where Chriſt commanded that the Tares and the Wheat ſhould be ſuffered to grow together till the harveſt, the day of judgement: And uſe or abuſe rather ſome other places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which as they conceive make all for a toleration of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.</p>
            <p>To all which their pretences, I ſhall at this time briefly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, after I have ſet downe ſome grounds out of holy Scripture, and produced ſome examples of Gods deare children friends and ſervants out of the ſame, which muſt be the warrant of all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to follow to the end of the world; for whatſoever was written before was written for our learning, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. and by the Word of God, and from the example of Gods ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, we are ever taught, that diverſity of Religions amongſt Chriſtians ought not to be tolerated.</p>
            <p>And firſt to begin with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the Father of the faithfull, and his ſeed, whoſe examples, all that are his and their children, oughtto ſet before their eyes for imitation: The Lord called <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi>
               <pb n="147" facs="tcp:158510:75"/>as it is in <hi>Joſhua</hi> 24. out of his Father <hi>Terah's</hi> houſe, and from his kindred, when they ſerved other Gods, &amp; made a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with him, as it is at large ſet downe in the 12. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and in divers other places of the ſame book, and in ſpeciall in the 17. of <hi>Geneſis, verſe</hi> 1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> where the Lord reneweth his covenant with him and his ſeed, and ſets downe the conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which was, that <hi>Abraham ſhould walk before him and be perfect,</hi> and that then he would be his God al ſufficient to provide for him and protect him where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came; which covenant the Lord ever kept with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and his ſeed, delivering them out of the hands of all their enemies, when they ſerved him according to the conditions of the covenant, walking uprightly before him (as he will doe to all his children to the end of the world, walking in father <hi>Abraham's</hi> ſteps) and of <hi>Abraham</hi> the Lord ſayes this, in the 18. of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſis, ver.</hi> 17, 18, 19. <hi>Shall I hide from</hi> Abraham <hi>that which I doe, ſeeing that</hi> Abraham <hi>ſhall become a great and a mighty Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and all the Nations of the earth ſhall be bleſſed in him? for I know him, that he will command his children and houſhould after him, that they ſhall keep the way of the Lord, to doe Juſtice and Judgement, that the Lord may bring upon</hi> Abraham <hi>that which he hath ſpoken of him, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe words, we have Gods teſtimony of <hi>Abraham,</hi> in the which he gives this witneſſe of him, that he would command his children and houſhold after him, that they ſhould keep the way of the Lord to doe juſtice and judgement: Then it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, that <hi>Abraham</hi> tolerated neither in his children, nor in his houſhold any Religion contrary unto that that God had taught him, nor ſuffered no Idolatry nor ſects in his family, for this had not been to walk uprightly before God, for it had been unjuſt dealing with God ſo to have done; for <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed were to walk perfectly and ſincerely before God, and therefore he would never tolerate all Religions or the worſhipping of a falſe God, or the worſhip of the true God after a falſe manner, which alſo is idolatry, for this had not been to doe juſtice and judgement; but <hi>Abraham</hi> ſet up the true worſhip of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he came, as the whole ſtory of his life doth abundantly declare: And ſo did <hi>Iſaac</hi> after him, and <hi>Jacob</hi> after him, as in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:158510:76"/>the 33. of <hi>Gen.</hi> doth appeare, where <hi>Iacob</hi> ſaid, <hi>unto his houſhold and to all that were with him, put away the ſtrange gods that are among you, and be cleane, and change your garments, and let us ariſe and goe up to</hi> Bethel, <hi>and I will make there an Altar unto God who anſwered me in the day of my diſtreſſe, and was with me in the way which I went; and they gave unto</hi> Jacob <hi>all the ſtrange gods that were in their hands, and</hi> Jacob <hi>hid them under the Oake that was at</hi> Sechem, <hi>and the terrour of God was upon the cities which were round about them, and they did not purſue after the ſonnes of</hi> Jacob.</p>
            <p>In theſe words we have a preſident for imitation with the fruit and benefit that doth redound to al thoſe people &amp; Nations that ſet up the true worſhip of God, and root out all idolatry and falſe worſhip out of their families &amp; countries; for <hi>Iacob</hi> gives no toleration in his houſe nor amongſt his people for all Religions, or for any other but that which God himſelfe had appointed; he ſets up the true worſhip of God, and that onely within his Juriſdiction and buries all the Idols, of what price and how rich ſoever they were, and he found the comfort and benefit of this his ſo doing; for the Lord for this his faithfull ſervice, bleſſed him and protected him from the fury of all his provoked ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; for the terror of God was upon them all, ſo that they durſt not purſue him.</p>
            <p>And if we take notice in our reading of the holy Scriptures, we ſhall find and that through the whole Word of God that the Lord ever followed that people and thoſe Kings and governours and their whole Kingdomes and countries with ſpeciall bleſſings and ſingular favours that purged their country from idolatry and all falſe worſhips, and ſtruck a terror into all their enemies round about them; neither did they ever purge their countries from idolatry, and root out idolaters, but the anger of the Lord was preſently appeaſed by it, and it is alwayes recorded to the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall praiſe and honour of thoſe Kings, Rulers and Judges that were moſt forward in reformation, and that ſet more throughly upon that good work of reformation; and thoſe that did things but to the halves in reformation, have not ſo honourable a teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony in holy Scripture as the other: and that God has ever been pleaſed when idolatry has been rooted out, and idolaters
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:158510:76"/>put to death, there be many preſidents of it in the Word of God.</p>
            <p>Amongſt others, that in the 32. of <hi>Exodus,</hi> how highly was God diſpleaſed there with the making of that Calfe? and how well was he pleaſed when execution was done upon the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and authors of that idolatry? that place ſufficiently declareth, yea, in the 13. of <hi>Deuteronomie,</hi> the Lord declaring how much he deteſteth idolatry &amp; all falſe worſhip, giveth a diſpenſation to children for diſobedience to their parents (who by his law they are bound to obey) in Gods matters; ſo that if thoſe of their nigheſt relations ſhould goe about to intice any to idolatry, or to the worſhipping of falſe gods, or the true God in a falſe manner, or ſhould endeavour but to bring in another Riligion than that the Lord had appointed, that then they ſhould bring them forth and have juſtice done againſt them; ſo that God abhorreth that any Religion amongſt his owne people ſhould be tolerated or ſet up beſides that he himſelfe hath commanded; and he had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid in his law, that any man ſhould make to themſelves any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Image, or ſet up any way of worſhipping him but that which he himſelfe had ordained and injoyned, and commanded that they that ſhould attempt any ſuch thing ſhould be put to death.</p>
            <p>We ſee likewiſe what <hi>Joſhua</hi> did according to the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement of God, who ought to be a patterne to all chriſtians, and all chriſtian Magiſtrates, chap. 24. ver. 14.15, 16. <hi>Now there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>fear the Lord and ſerve him in ſincerity and in truth, and put away the gods which your Fathers ſerved on the other ſide of the flood and in</hi> Egypt, <hi>and ſerve ye the Lord; and if it ſeem evill unto you to ſerve the Lord, chooſe you this day whom yee will ſerve, whether the gods which your Fathers ſerved that were on the other ſide of the flood, or the gods of the</hi> Amorites, <hi>in whoſe land yee dwell; but for me and my houſe we will ſerve the Lord:</hi> And the people anſwered and ſaid, <hi>God forbid that we ſhould for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Lord and ſerve other gods, for the Lord our God is he that brought us up and our Fathers out of the land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>out of the houſe of bondage, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here we may obſerve, firſt, that <hi>Joſhua</hi> injoynes them to ſerve the Lord in ſincerity and in truth, and that they might do that, to
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158510:77"/>put away all their idols; he gives no toleration of all Religions: and the like may be ſaid of <hi>Joſhua, Joſ.</hi> 24.15. and that they might with the more alacrity yeeld obedience to God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, he ſets his owne example before their eyes, with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, which was, that both he and his houſhold would ſerve the Lord onely and ſet up his worſhip, and all the people like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe aſſented to doe the ſame, and gave their reaſon why they would ſerve the Lord, and tolerate no other Religion, becauſe ſay they, the Lord hath brought us up out of the land of <hi>Aegypt</hi> and out of the houſe of bondage and made us his peculiar people, and therefore they reſolved to ſerve him onely, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate no other ſervice amongſt them but that which God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe had commanded and appointed: And this example of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhua</hi> and the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> is left to all the people of God, to all ages for imitation, whoſe duty it is to ſet up the true worſhip of God onely amongſt them, and none but that which Chriſt their Redeemer, King and Law-giver hath injoyned them; and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all ſuch as would have all Religions tolerared, do exceedingly forget themſelves, and are highly unthankfull to Chriſt their King and Redeemer.</p>
            <p>And if we look into the ſtory of the Judges, the book following that of <hi>Joſhua,</hi> when this generation was dead, and that they had forgot their covenant, and began to tolerate all religions amongſt them, they brought downe all thoſe plagues upon themſelves by it, that were writen in the law of <hi>Moſes;</hi> and for no other cauſe, ſaith the holy Scripture, but for that they ſet up thoſe Religions the heathens had ſerved their gods by, as is manifeſt from the ſixth chapter; for <hi>when the people cryed unto the Lord becauſe of the</hi> Midianites; the Lord ſent a Prophet unto them firſt, who told them that the cauſe of all the judgements was, <hi>becauſe they had not obeyed the voyce of the Lord, but had ſerved the gods of the nations which he had forbidden them:</hi> and afterwards he ſent an Angel unto <hi>Gideon,</hi> and commanded him to break downe the <hi>Altar af Baal which his father had, and to cut downe the Grove that was by it, and to ſet up an Altar to the Lord:</hi> In the firſt place <hi>Gideon</hi> was enjoyned to root out idolatry, and then to ſet up Gods true worſhip onely; here we find no toleration of any Religion but the true Religion, when they ſet upon the work
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158510:77"/>of reformation and when the men of the City made inquiry after him that had broken down the Altar and cut downe the Grove, and would have put him to death, it is related, <hi>that Ioaſh</hi> the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Gideon <hi>ſaid</hi> to all that ſtood againſt him, <hi>Will ye plead for Baal? will ye ſave him? he that will plead for him let him be put to death whiles it is yet morning, if he be a god let him plead for himſelfe, becauſe one hath caſt downe his Altar:</hi> Here we find no toleration of Baal's Religion, but that they that would plead for him ſhould be put to death; and ſurely, thoſe that will plead for a toleration of all Religions, doe no leſſe than fight againſt God.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee what <hi>Elias</hi> did, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18. ver. 21. (who was counted as the Chariot and Horſe-men of <hi>Iſrael)</hi> with Baals Prieſts, and what he ſaid to all thoſe of his times, <hi>How long</hi> (ſaith he to the people) <hi>will ye halt between two Religions? if the Lord be God follow him, but if Baal be God then follow him.</hi> The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet would not admit, of a toleration of all Religions, but when God had miraculonſly manifeſted from Heaven that <hi>Elias</hi> his Religion was the true Religion, and which God in his holy Word had eſtabliſhed, all Baals Prieſts were put to death, and that by <hi>Elias</hi> his command, who ſaid, <hi>Take the Prophets of Baal let none of them eſcape, and they took them, and</hi> Elias <hi>took them and brought them downe to the Brook</hi> Kiſhon <hi>and ſlew them there.</hi> And ſo upon all reformations, all other Religions were caſt out but the true Religion, as we may ſee through the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as in the ſtories of the Kings and Chronicles, and thoſe of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and <hi>Ezra</hi> and through all the Prophets; and the Lord in the ſecond of <hi>Ieremiah</hi> complaineth againſt his people, that they had forſaken the fountaines of living water, that is, they had forſaken the true God and ſerved other gods, and forſaken their maker, and had been more unconſtant than the very Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, who had not forſaken their idoll gods, and therefore for this their rebellion and ingratitude, the Prophet denounces all thoſe plagues that were written in the law againſt them, as all the other Prophets did: for there is not any ſinne in all the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament that the Lord more complaines of than that of idolatry, and the toleration of many Religions amongſt them, as is moſt abundantly ſet downe both in <hi>Iſaiah, Ieremiah</hi> and <hi>Ezekiel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:158510:78"/>and in all the other Prophets, all which were written for our learning, ſo that if the people of God ſhall imitate them in their ſinnes, they muſt look to partake with them in their plagues; for the tolerating of all Religions would be a juſt provoking of the Lord our God to anger now, as it was then. And we have ſad ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience already, what the tolerating of the idolatry of the Maſſe, that <hi>Dagon</hi> of Ginger-bread, hath brought upon us; for God will not be mocked, if God be God, and the chriſtian Religion of the reformed Churches, and which we find in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and which was confirmed by ſo many ſignes and wonders, and miracles, be the true religion, than let that and that onely be ſet up amongſt Chriſtians, and no other tolerated, for if they be, they will ſpeedily bring the plagues of God upon the Kingdome, and confuſion upon us all; as we may well perceive by the ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of them but a few yeers, what good effects they will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce: for toleration of all Religions cannot be pleaſing unto God no more in our times, than it was amongſt his ancient peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the Jewes, and in the primitive Churches; and therefore all thoſe that plead for a toleration of all Religions are no friends of Chriſt nor lovers of Religion, pretend what they will; for neither <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> nor <hi>Iacob,</hi> nor any of the Prophets nor holy men of God would ſuffer it, neither would the Apoſtles ever endure it, but in all their writings give eſpeciall charge to all the people to take heed of all the falſe teachers of their time, and forewarnes them to take heed of them in all ſucceeding ages, ever deſcribing them by their crafty dealings, that they ſhould come in ſheeps cloathing, and in all-ſeeming holineſſe and fained ſimplicity, and therefore that they are the more to be avoyded: And <hi>Paul</hi> writing to the Galatians, in the fifth chapter, wiſht and deſired that the falſe Teachers were cut off, ſo far were the holy Apoſtles from tolerating all Religions, as in all their Epiſtles they invay againſt them and that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually as falſe Apoſtles and deceivers, and command all chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians to receive no other Religion but that which they had taught them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. and bids the people come out of <hi>Babylon;</hi> and tels them there is no fellowſhip with light and darkneſſe, and ſurely if al the Prophets &amp; Apoſtles did command al the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God to come out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> they never gave leave to any
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:158510:78"/>Chriſtians to ſet up <hi>Babylon</hi> amongſt them, and to tolerate the confuſion and mingling together of, all Religions, for this would be a thing not onely againſt the Scripture and revealed will of God, but againſt all ſolid reaſon and ſound judgement.</p>
            <p>Nay we ſee that Chriſt himſelfe in writing to the ſeven Churches in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and in them to all Chriſtians in the world, he blames the Angel of the Church of <hi>Pergamus,</hi> and that of <hi>Thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atira,</hi> in the ſecond chapter, in theſe words, <hi>To the Angel in the Church of</hi> Pergamus, <hi>write theſe things, ſaith he that hath the ſharp ſword with two edges, I know thy works and where thou dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt, even where ſatans ſeat is, and thou holdeſt faſt my Name, and haſt not denyed my faith, even in thoſe dayes wherein</hi> Antipas <hi>my faithfull Martyr, who was ſlaine among you, where ſatan dwelleth: but I have a few things againſt thee, becauſe thou haſt them there that hold the doctrin of</hi> Baalam, <hi>who taught</hi> Baalak <hi>to caſt a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-block before the children of Iſrael, and to eat things ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed unto idols, and to commit fornication: ſo haſt thou them alſo that hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, which thing I hate: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, or elſe I come unto thee quickly, and will ſight againſt thee with the ſword of my mouth. And unto the Angel of the Church of Thyatira write, theſe things ſaith the Sonne of God, who hath his eyes like unto a flame of fire, and his feet like fine braſſe, I know thy works and charity and ſervice, and faith, and thy pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thy works and the laſt to be more than the firſt; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I have a few things againſt thee becauſe thou ſuffereſt that woman</hi> Jezabel <hi>which calleth her ſelfe a propheteſſe to teach and ſeduce my ſervants to commit fornication, and to eat things ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed unto idols, &amp;c.</hi> and in the 3. chap. ver. 14. <hi>Unto the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel of the Church of</hi> Laodicea <hi>write theſe things, ſaith the</hi> Amen, <hi>the faithfull and true Witneſſe, the beginning of the creation of God, I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot, I would thou were cold or hot; ſo then becauſe thou art lukewarme, and neither cold nor hot, I will ſpew thee out of my mouth, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Out of the which places, it is ſufficiently manifeſt, that it is a thing highly diſpleaſing unto God, that his people ſhould give a toleration of any Religion but that he hath eſtabliſhed and thoſe that labour for a toleration of all Religions muſt needs be luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warme,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:158510:79"/>neither hot nor cold, which is an evill the Lord is ſo much diſpleaſed with, as he tels them that he will ſpew them out of his mouth; and ſurely there is nothing that ſavours more of licentiouſneſſe and eareleſneſſe in Religion, and want of zeal to Gods glory in any men, than when they would bring in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of all Religions: And many of them can report, that there is no Religion in Holland, where there is a toleration of all Religions, though it is well knowne that there are men in that Country of the native Dutch people, that are as zealous for the true religion as any of them, and are as much deſirous that tolerations of all religions amongſt them were not there permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as they now wiſh a toleration of all religions were ſuffered here amongſt us; for they find by experience that it is an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of all prophaneneſſe, and if they ſhould have there the like occaſions of civill combuſtions as we have, through Gods diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure for our ſinnes and ingratitude towards him, here in <hi>England,</hi> I am afraid they would find the toleration of all thoſe religions amongſt them, would prove an intolerable thing to them, if not the cauſe of the ruine of their whole Country. The Lord divert his judgements from them, and grant that they may never taſte of the miſeries that we now are acquainted with, but for tolerating of popery and Arminianiſme, and the prelaticall faction and without doubt if the ſuffering but of theſe three has ſo diſpleaſed God, the tolerating of all would give him a juſt cauſe of his more hot indignation.</p>
            <p>But now to anſwer to their Objections in order; the Heathens ſay the Independents ſuffered <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> and all the Patriarchs and the people of Iſrael where ever they came to exerciſe their owne religion, and tolerated all religions amongſt them. For anſwer, let them take notice, that no thank is due to the heathens for it (as we may ſee in <hi>Geneſis,</hi> the 12. chap. and the 20 chap. and chap. 26.) but onely the glory of that is to be aſcribed to God who reſtrained them when they intended evill againſt them; for he appeared to ſome of them in viſions, and commanded them not to touch his anointed people, and forbad them to doe his Prophets any harme, and by the ſpeciall bleſſings that he rained downe upon his people, and by his miraculous preſerving of them in fiery furnaces and in Lyons dens, from the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:158510:79"/>fury of Savage-beaſts, &amp; delivering them ſo often out of the hands of all their enemies, he ſtruck ſuch a terror into the heathen na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that they durſt not oppreſſe his people, ſo that the ſingular providence of God, who watcheth over them alwayes for good, was their ſhield and Buckler; ſo that what they did in tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating them and their Religion, was not of their good nature, but it was Gods ſpeciall favour towards his owne peculiar people, and for the maintainance of his owne Cauſe, and that Religion which they had learned from him; and therefore thoſe heatheniſh examples are not for Chriſtians imitation to tolerate all Religions, who are bound to obey Gods commandements, and to follow the example of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and all the holy Prophets and Apoſtles, who all of them have condemned the toleration of all Religions amongſt his people, and have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced Gods judgements againſt them for ſo doing.</p>
            <p>Againe, we muſt conſider the principles of the heathen Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and the practice of all wicked godleſſe politicians in all ages; for the Philoſophers, though they were ſufficiently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by their naturall reaſon, that there was a God, and that this God was the author of all good, and the puniſher of all evill, and therefore that he ought to be feared and ſerved of all nations and people, yet becauſe they by that naturall light of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding (which was but darkneſſe in them) could not comprehend what that infinite Majeſty and divine being and God-head was, and were not in themſelves able to ſet downe a deſcription of him, nor how to conceive of that inviſible Deity, nor what wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would be moſt pleaſing unto him (which they could never doe without God himſelfe had revealed himſelfe unto them as he did to his owne people) they ſerved him after ſome traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons they had received from their fathers, and left all nations, cities and families to ſerve God as they thought beſt, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their owne vaine imaginations; and for the Atheiſticall politicians of all ages, all Religions are one to them, who never regard any one more than another, and therefore tolerate all for their owne baſe ends, and think it beſt for the enriching of all their countries (as the experience of all ages and hiſtories can ſufficiently witneſſe) and many of them doe not refraine to ſay, that Religion was onely brought into the world out of policy,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:158510:80"/>and to keep people in awe; ſo that God of his infinite goodneſſe having the ordering of all mens hearts in his hands, did ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of all things, that by their owne principles they ſhould give toleration of all Religions in their ſeverall countryes and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, ſo that his people being ſcattered here and there through other nations by their ſinnes, yet found this favour, that they alſo for the moſt part enjoyed the liberty of their Religion (though they met ſometimes with moſt hot perſecutions) but all this is ever to be aſcribed to God alone (as I ſaid before) and to his over-ſwaying providence and guidance, who ever preſerved thoſe that truſt in him and ſerved him according to his revealed will, though it be in <hi>Babylon</hi> it ſelfe, and therefore it is not to be attributed to the good nature of the Heathen neither would that toleration now be tolerable in Chriſtians, who have learned Chriſt otherwiſe than to ſet up any Religion but that which he the King and Prophet of his Church hath taught them.</p>
            <p>But now I will briefly anſwer to what they pretend out of Scripture, and runne through the ſeverall Objections drawne from thence.</p>
            <p>And firſt to begin with that of <hi>Joſhua</hi> 21. where he ſaith, <hi>chooſe you this day whom you will ſerve, &amp;c.</hi> In theſe words, by their favour, there is no toleration of many Religions, for he was to follow the law of God, and not to decline from it, neither to the right hand nor to the left, <hi>Joſhua</hi> 1. and by that law he was forbid to ſuffer or tolerate any Religion but that which <hi>Moſes</hi> had taught them; and therefore thoſe words were a meere ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny, and to find out thoſe that were idolaters to puniſh them, as any wiſe governour may at any time make uſe of the like <hi>Query,</hi> to find out men not well affected to Religion or to their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, that by this meanes they may be brought to condigne puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: As if now any Officer or Commander, under the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould ſay to a company of men that he were jealous of, being deſirous to diſcover them and find them out chooſe you this day who you will ſerve, whether the King or the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but for my ſelfe and my houſe we will ſerve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: would not any by and by gather that he ſpake this onely to find out Malignants to puniſh them? Even ſo <hi>Joſhua</hi> a wiſe and religious governour did the ſame, not that he over intended
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:158510:80"/>to give them a toleration of all religions for that had been againſt the law of God and againſt their owne example for in the 22. of <hi>Ioſhua,</hi> we read that becauſe the people had built but an Altar on the other ſide of <hi>Iordan,</hi> they intended forthwith to make war upon them (a preſident to teach chriſtians that they may fight for their religion) and they had gone out to battell againſt them and had deſtroyed them, had they not given a ſatisfactory anſwer that they had no intent to bring in any innovation in religion; and therefore this is but a poor cavill: Now for that they pretend out of <hi>Gamaliel's</hi> ſpeech, <hi>Acts</hi> 5. ver. 38, 39. where he ſayth, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraine from theſe men</hi> (ſpeaking of the Apoſtles) <hi>and let them alone, for if this counſell or this work be of men, it will come to nought; but if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it, leaſt happly ye be found fighters againſt God:</hi> Ergo, all Religions are to be tolerated.</p>
            <p>This Objection has ſufficiently ſhewn that our brethren the Independents that thus argue, may well be made fellowes of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tham-Colledge,</hi> as knowing not as yet their Primer in polititicks, nor their Catechiſme in divinity: For who knowes not that it is as eaſie with God who is of infinite wiſdome, out of mens fooliſhneſſe to procure ſafety for his owne people, as it was for him, out of <hi>Achitaphels wiſdome</hi> to bring deſtruction upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and to turne his wiſdome into fooliſhneſſe; for that which <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſpake was neither as a wiſe man, nor as a Chriſtian; for he would never be thought a wiſe man that hearing of any commotion in the Kingdome, and had the power in his hands to ſuppres it, ſhould ſay if it be of men it will come to naught, but if it be of God if we ſhal oppoſe it, we ſhal be found fighters againſt God, and therefore let us let them alone; would not all the world think this man a Ninny, that ſhould thus ſpeak, and a man unworthy to ſit in counſell in any State? whereas a wiſe man if he hears of any inſurrection he will forthwith uſe the weapons of his right hand and firſt ſeek God by prayer and in his Ordinances, and then betake himſelfe to the weapons of the left hand and uſe the ſword to ſuppreſſe them, and this man would be thought a wiſe man that ſhould ſo doe, and not he that with <hi>Gamaliel</hi> ſhould ſay, if it be of men it will come to nought, and ſo let them goe on to doe miſchife: Neither did he anſwer as a chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158510:81"/>for what chriſtian that ſhould heare of any new monſtrous Religion newly printed &amp; newly come forth (as there are many at this day to be ſold about towne and Country for pence apiece) and ſhould underſtand that ſome of thoſe ancient hereſies were againe revived, as that of the Arians, Pelagians, or Neſtorians, ſhould ſay let them alone, for if they be of men they will come to nought, but if they be of God ye cannot overthrow them, leſt you will be found fighters againſt God, and ſo let the ſeducers goe on without queſtioning them, or ſuppreſſing their hereſies; would not every man that hath any feare of God in him ſay, ſurely that man that ſhould thus anſwer, did not ſpeak like a chriſtian? for a good chriſtian like the good Bereans would ſay, come let us ſit downe and examine theſe new doctrines newly brought into the world by the holy Scriptures, and let us follow the example of the Apoſtles, <hi>Act. ch.</hi> 15. in that aſſembly and ſearch the Scriptures, and if we find them not to be grounded on the Word of God, nor to be of God, let us forthwith as God himſelfe hath commanded, ſuppreſſe them and not ſay, without examining of them, as wiſe <hi>Gamaliel</hi> let them alone, that was not God's method; for God ſent his people to the law and to the teſtimony, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8 and proclaimes that all that ſpeak not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, it is becauſe there is no light in them, and that all opinions not grounded on the Word, are but darkneſſe and errour, and therefore they are not to be tolerated or ſuffered; ſo that for any man to gather a toleration of all Religions from <hi>Gamaliels</hi> ſpeech, is but to prove himſelfe a meere groll; and as little to the purpoſe is that they urge out of the words of our Saviour, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22. where anſwering the Sadduces, he ſaith, <hi>Ye doc erre not knowing the Scripture nor the power of God,</hi> v. 29. From whence the Independent brethren conclude a toleration of all Religions, for our Saviour ſay they, onely convinced them of their errour, and yet tolerated them and ſuffered them to enjoy the liberty of their conſcience.</p>
            <p>I have heard many magnifie our Independent brethren for their great learning, ſome affirming that they were ſchollers from their mothers womb, and I for my part beleeve it, for ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God and of his holy Word came with all men from their mothers wombe, and if ſuch interpretations of Scripture
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158510:81"/>and ſuch illations from them, as theſe be proceed not from the ignorance of God and of the Scripture never any did; for what learned man that knowes what Chriſts office was in taking hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature upon him, when he became a Mediator and the high Prieſt of our redemption, would argue as theſe men doe; eſpecially when Chriſt hath ſo often in holy Scripture profeſſed of himſelf that he came then to ſave thoſe that were loſt, and not to judge the world; for he hath left that imployment till his next comming, when I am moſt aſſured theſe men will have a great deale to anſwer for, for ſo abuſing the holy Scriptures to maintaine their owne baggatellies: Beſides, Chriſt came to keep the law for us, which he himſelfe had given unto his people and took no way the office of a judge upon him, but in ſcourging out the buyers &amp; ſellers out of the Temple that I remember, and ſaith, that he came not to break the bruiſed reed, or quench the ſmoking flax, onely he had declared his lawes unto his people, <hi>Malachy</hi> the 4. by his ſervant <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the execution of theſe lawes was put into the hands of the Elders of Iſrael, whoſe place it was to puniſh all ſeducers, and who ſhould have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med that work of juſtice which our Saviour declaring doth not give liberty for the tolerating of all Religions, which was againſt the revealed will of God; and therefore they that will out of this place argue a toleration of all Religions, may as vvell conclude, that Chriſt tolerated adultery and injuſtice, and all manner of vvickedneſſe, becauſe our Saviour Chriſt ſaid unto thoſe that brought the Woman to him, that vvas found in the act of uncleanneſſe, he that is without ſinne amongſt you, let him caſt the firſt ſtone, and vvhen her accuſers vvere gone, ſaid unto the woman, Woman where are thy accuſers, goe thy way and ſinne no more. Ergo, Chriſt gave a toleration for all Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers; and when the young man in the 16. of <hi>Luke</hi> came to our Saviour and complaining of unjuſtice done unto him by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and deſiring him to ſpeak unto his brother that he would di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide the inheritance with him, to whom our Saviour anſwered, <hi>man, who made me a judge or a divider among you? ergo,</hi> Chriſt gave toleration of all injuſtice. And becauſe our Saviour Chriſt ſaid in that Parable of the good ſeed that was ſown and of the tares that ſprung up, that they ſhould let them alone till the harveſt, an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:158510:82"/>which they much depend on: Ergo, all wicked men are to be tolerated and no juſtice to be done upon them till Dooms-day, &amp; they are to live without moleſtation, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate ought not to meddle with them, becauſe Chriſt ſaid, let the good corne and the tares grow together till the harveſt; who would not admire to heare any man thus to argue, that there ſhould be ſuch either folly or wickedneſſe in the heart of man, to abuſe the holy Scriptures for their owne ends? And who knowes not, that it is concluded amongſt all learned men, that <hi>Simbolica Theologianon eſt argumentativa;</hi> and that the Parable inferres no more, but that it is not for any private man to take upon him the Magiſtrates office, or raſhly to intrude himſelfe into the place of Rulers and Governours: But truly all ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences may as well be gathered from every one of the above ſpecified Scriptures, as they gather from our Saviours words to the Sadduces, and from the Parable of Chriſt for the tolerating of all Religions, and therefore all ſuch argumentations as theſe are but poore props to uphold their Tenent: For God-hath given us that are chriſtians both the Law and the Goſpell, by which we ought to be guided in the ſerving of him, and by the which all Chriſtians are directed what courſe to take in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing of vice, and for the ſuppreſſing of errors and offenders, whether they be delinquents in doctrine or manners: And although chriſtians by the Goſpell are freed from the ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all law, yet we are not freed from the ſubſtance of it; for he that ſaid to the Iſraelites, <hi>be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> ſaith alſo to all chriſtians, <hi>be ye holy as I am holy,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1: ſo that although the ceremony be aboliſhed, yet the ſubſtance remaineth ſtil in force; and although the rigor of the judiciall law be taken away, and chriſtians are not tied to that manner of adminiſtration of juſtice, yet the equity of that law doth ſtill continue, and righteous judgement is every where amongſt all chriſtians to be executed, and ſatisfaction to be made to all ſuch as have been unjuſtly damnified; and although we are freed from the curſe, maledi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and coaction of the morall law, yet we are not freed from the obedience of it; ſo that whatſoever was commanded in it to the Iſraelites, or forbidden them, the ſame is both comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and forbidden to all chriſtians to the ends of the world, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:158510:82"/>whatſoever was death by the law of God and nature then, for ought I know, ought to be puniſhed with death now amongſt Chriſtians as blaſphemours, wizards, witches, idolaters, and all ſuch as deſpiſe <hi>Moſes</hi> law; under the month of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if they be people within the pale of the Church, and make profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion; for Chriſtians have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do with thoſe that are without to judg them except they offend againſt the civill and municipal laws of the country, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the laws of nations &amp; nature when they live amongſt them: for Chriſt came not to change the morall law but to ratifie it in all things. And although the Sabbath be changed in reſpect of the day, yet for the holineſſe of the firſt day of the week (which is the Chriſtians Sabbath) and which is in place of it, I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent it ought moſt carefully to be obſerved, and that the whole day ought in all ſanctity and holineſſe to be kept, and beſides the fourth Commandement for the ſanctification of a ſeventh day, we have the example of the primitive Chriſtians and bleſſed Apoſtles, who alwayes had their meetings on the firſt day of the week, and ſpent the whole day in the duties of piety and charity; for in the 20. of the <hi>Acts</hi> we read, that on the firſt day of the week the Diſciples came together to break bread, that was for the hearing of the Word, and for the adminiſtration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, and for the exerciſing of all holy duties and that <hi>Paul</hi> preached there untill midnight, and that when <hi>Euticus</hi> was fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len downe with ſleep. <hi>Paul</hi> reſtored him to life againe to all their comforts; ſo that here we have one preſident, that the whole Lords day was ſpent by all thoſe Chriſtians in the works of piety and charity. Againe in the firſt of the <hi>Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> Saint <hi>John</hi> ſaith that <hi>he was in the Spirit on the Lord's day,</hi> that is, the firſt day of the week called by Saint <hi>John</hi> the Lord's day, and there the Angel preached unto him that day, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Saint <hi>John</hi> to take ſo much of his Sermon by writing, as God in his wiſdome thought fit to reveale unto his Church, and he that ſhall diligently read what is there written, will ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that the whole day was taken up by Saint <hi>John</hi> and ſpent in hearing, and writing, and meditating of what he had heard; for without doubt Saint <hi>John</hi> made it his whole dayes work to be ſpiritually imployed, and as the holy Communion is called
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:158510:83"/>the Lord's Supper, and all the time of that action is holily to be imployed, as being ordained by Chriſt himſelfe to that end; even ſo the Lords day being a day dedicated unto Chriſt, and ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him for holy duties, and for the hearing of the Word, and for the adminiſtration of the Sacraments and prayer, the whole day ought both privately and publikely to be taken up in the imployments and works of piety and charity, as hearing, read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meditating, prayer, repetition of Sermons in their Families, catechizing and inſtructing their children and ſervants ſinging of Pſalmes, in viſiting the ſick and them that are in priſon, relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the poore and neceſſitated &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe examples of the primitive Chriſtians are for our imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation for ſo Saint <hi>Paul</hi> in the third of the <hi>Phillippians</hi> in the 17. verſe ſaith; <hi>Brethren, be followers together of me, and mark them which walk ſo, as ye have us for an example, for our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in Heaven.</hi> And in the 4. chap. ver. 8. he ſaith, <hi>Final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly brethren, whatſoever things are true, what ſoever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, whatſoever things are juſt, whatſoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things: Thoſe things which ye have both learned and received, and heard, and ſeen in me, doe, and the God of peace ſhall be with you.</hi> By the which teſtimonies to omit many more, we are tyed to follow the examples of the Apoſtles, and to imitate them in all that is holy and good, and of good report; now it is praiſe worthy and of good report to ſpend the whole Lords day in holy imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and we have the Apoſtles examples and the primitive Chriſtians for ſo doing, and therefore we ought to ſpend the whole Lords day in the works of piety and charity; and by this the ſanctifying of the Chriſtian Sabbath, (which is every ſeventh day) is ratified; the prophanation of the which in the reformed Churches, and in many places through theſe three Kingdomes has been one of the cauſes of all thoſe heavy judgements the whole chriſtian world now groanes under, and ſo much more would the Lord be provoked by the toleration of all Religions amongſt us which would give juſt occaſion of violating of all the Commandements of God, and of diſobedience both to God and man; for it is moſt ſure, that the morall law is not altered
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:158510:83"/>in any thing for ſubſtance, and that God that by it injoyned but one Religion to the Iſraelites, and commanded them to keep that pure and undefiled, and to puniſh all idolaters, blaſphemers and ſeducers hath injoyned the ſame to all Chriſtians, and hath not ſuffered or permitted them to tolerate all Religions or any ſects or hereſies which by the Apoſtle in the fifth of the <hi>Galati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are called the works of the devill; and that they that doe them ſhall not enter into the Kingdome of God. So that thoſe that would bring in a toleration of all Religions, have a deſire to ſend men to the devill.</p>
            <p>For the examples of <hi>Poland, Tranſſilvania</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi> they are no preſidents to other Nations, their politick proceedings are no examples for other chriſtian Countries and Nations to follow; for chriſtians are to live by the rule of God's Word, and Chriſt's their Kings lawes, and to follow the examples of his own people only in their wel-doing, and not in their failings; and therfore we are to follow the example of <hi>Abraham, Joſhua Elias</hi> &amp; the other Patriarchs, Prophets, and holy Apoſtles who never tolerated all Religions. Yea, we are commanded in <hi>Romans</hi> the 12. <hi>not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme our ſelves to this world, but that we ſhould be transformed by the renewing of our minds, that we may prove what is the good and the acceptable and perfect will of God.</hi> Now when by the Word of God that acceptable and perfect will of his we are taught that he was diſpleaſed with his people the Jewes, for tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating of all Religions amongſt them, and that he was highly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with thoſe chriſtian Churches in <hi>Aſia</hi> for tolerating the doctrines of <hi>Balaan</hi> and <hi>Jezabel,</hi> we are ſufficiently taught and inſtructed, that Chriſtians ought not to tolerate any other Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion but that which Chriſt the onely King and Law-giver of his Church hath taught us, and that whoſoever ſhould take that au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon them to tolerate all Religions, would be found fighters againſt God, and ſuch as deſervedly would bring downe his judgements upon the Land by it; for if but conniving at evill and conſenting to it be a thing diſpleaſing unto God, how would the tolerating of it by a law be abominable unto his ſacred and divine Majeſty? for this were to eſtabliſh iniquity by a law. We are taught in the holy Scriptures, that the conſenting with a theefe makes a man as guilty before God as the acting of thee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:158510:84"/>and that they that aſſented unto <hi>Jezabel</hi> in killing the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, made themſelves all as guilty as <hi>Jezabel</hi> her ſelfe, and that the Heathen Romans <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. ver. 32. <hi>who knowing the judgement of God (that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death) not onely doe the ſame but conſent with them that doe them;</hi> made themſelves as equally guilty as the actors of them, as <hi>Paul</hi> in his bill and information put up in the Court of Heaven againſt them ſufficiently declareth; the ſame did <hi>Elias</hi> in his bill of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the people in his time, accuſing them all as equally guilty of the blood of the Prophets, and deſtroying Religion as <hi>Jezabel,</hi> and onely becauſe they conſented unto it; <hi>They</hi> (ſaith <hi>Elias) have killed thy Prophets and have broken down thy Altars:</hi> Which they? all the people that aſſented unto her, as well as the Officers and Executioners: And ſo our Saviour in his time, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſeth the people as well as <hi>Herod</hi> for ſlaying of <hi>Iohn</hi> the Baptiſt ſaying, <hi>They have done to him what ſoever they pleaſed.</hi> They, which they? all the Nobles that ſate at table with <hi>Herod,</hi> that did not diſſwade <hi>Herod</hi> from that bloody and tyrannicall act, and all the people that liked well of it: the ſinne of this Nation who aſſented unto the bloody decrees and cenſures given in the High-commiſſion-Courts, and in the Star-Chamber, and in all other unjuſt Courts, the people that aſſented unto all their cruell cenſures againſt Gods people and liked well of it, are as equally guilty, who would ordinarily ſay, that had they been Judges they would have done the like, and that they were men worthy of death, which made them (I ſay) as equally guilty as their wicked Judges and Executioners; as we may ſee alſo in thoſe that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto the High-Prieſts, and to the Scribes and Phariſees in putting to death the Lord of life, they made themſelves all guilty of his blood, and by that meanes brought the curſe of God upon them and their children by it to this day as well as the High-Prieſts themſelves: a fearfull ſinne, though the world take no notice of it, and which all theſe Kingdomes have yet to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of: Saint <hi>Paul</hi> alſo makes himſelfe as guilty of <hi>Stephen's</hi> blood, as they that ſtoned him, ſaying, <hi>When the holy Martyr</hi> Stephen <hi>was ſtoned, I ſtood by and aſſented unto it, and held the garments of thoſe that stoned him:</hi> By which he acknowledgeth himſelfe equally guilty, and ſo all thoſe that aſſented to all the
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:158510:84"/>cruelty done to the people of God in theſe Kingdomes, and were approvers of their tyranny, are as guilty as the actors of it, for conſenting unto any treaſon or conſpiracy, or with any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors, and all their complices, both by the law of God nature and nations, makes them all guilty before God and men, and as liable to juſtice and puniſhment as thoſe that acted in thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefices; and therefore thoſe that but aſſent unto a toleration of all Religions (a ſinne ſo highly diſpleaſing unto God) are as guilty as the actors of it; and if but conſenting make them guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, how guilty are they then that uſe arguments to bring in a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leration of all Religions, and abuſe the Scriptures to this end, and plead for it, and would have it eſtabliſhed by a law? ſurely they are offenders againſt divine Majeſty in an elevated nature, and have a great deal to anſwer for it before God eſpecially when they doe it in a moſt ſcurrilous and railing manner, by which they manifeſt to all the world that they are more verſt and better acquainted with the doctrine of <hi>Billingſgate</hi> than with the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of <hi>Canaan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this may ſeeme a wonderfull thing to all judicious men, that that people which within theſe ſix yeers were afraid of a Surplice &amp; of the croſſe in Baptiſme and of any popiſh ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or of any of their vain traditions and wil-worſhip (which was their honour then) ſhould now plead for the toleration of the body and ſoule of popery, and for all other both jewiſh and heatheniſh Religions, and all manner of ſects, ſo deſtructive to that Religion, which the King of Saints and King of Kings, and the onely King of his Church, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelfe hath taught us, and to the peace and quietneſſe of the Land; this I ſay muſt needs ſeem a monſtrous thing to any moderate mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Chriſtian: Nay, how unreaſonably doe theſe men deale with their brethren? they plead for a toleration of all Religions here in <hi>England</hi> and yet in <hi>New England</hi> baniſh men into Iſlands from amongſt them, for diſſenting from them in their new modell of Church government, and for but diſſenting from them in their opinions about Religion; and here amongſt us what impious and railing books doe they make againſt the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for endeavouring to eſtabliſh that Religion and that church-government that God himſelfe in his holy Word hath ſet down?
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:158510:85"/>and what opprobrious names doe they give the faithful and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full Preachers and Paſtors of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> calling them Baals Prieſts the profeſt enemies of Jeſus Chriſt &amp; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, the limms of Antichriſt, falſe Prophets the brood of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> terming ſome particular men of them <hi>Rabſhekes,</hi> others Bands, others Black mouthes, legall preachers, and ſtiling all of them the curſed enemies of Jeſus Chriſt, and think of them as men not worthy to live, and in expreſſe words profeſſe it; and yet theſe men plead for a toleration of all Religions, when both by their words and deeds they manifeſt, if it were in their power, the firſt work they would do ſhould be to root us all out of the King<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dome: ſo that all men may ſee, they ſay one thing and meane another, that they would tolerate all Religions, but onely that which is the true Religion, &amp; ſo by that meanes have no Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on at all but one of their own making, which by their new lights they have of late found out, which they call <hi>the ſtraight way to Heaven, and the onely way of ſetting up Chriſt upon his Throne,</hi> which is nothing elſe, to ſay the truth, but to diſthrone him and ſet up themſelves and their new modell, for who doth not ſee how already they lord it over all good chriſtians, not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to the Sacraments but upon their owne termes, nor ſuffering their children to be baptized amongſt them, nor ſo much as ſuffering any they call Presbiterians to preach in their new congregated Aſſemblies: &amp; if this be to give a toleration of any Religion but their owne, let all the world judge: but I ſay, and will ever by Gods aſſiſtance be able to make it good, in that they plead for a toleration of all Religions, they are as guilty of hainous and ſoule ſinnes being complices, as well as they that are actors.</p>
            <p>Now then, when the Presbiters of the Church of <hi>England</hi> ſeek and endeavour in all their proceedings to eſtabliſh that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which Chriſt the King of his Church hath taught them and his bleſſed Apoſtles, and labour to ſet up that government that was ordained in all Churches to be perpetuated to the end of the world; in their ſo doing, they imitate all the Patriarchs, Prophets and Apoſtles, and in that they doe more advance Chriſt's Kingdome than the Independents, who under pretence of liberty of conſcience, would bring in a toleration of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:158510:85"/>and confuſion upon us all. Surely, if ever any Miniſters de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved well from the people, the Miniſters of <hi>England</hi> now doe, who by all their endeavours ſhew that they ſeek to bring them to the knowledge of God and of his Sonne Jeſus Chriſt, and to the knowledge of themſelves which is life eternall: For what could men doe more than that which they have done, who have petitioned the houſe of Lords and Commons now ſitting in the great Counſell of the Kingdome, that they might be armed with authority from them in their ſeverall charges, to have the examination of ſuch as ſhall be admitted to the Sacraments, that they may be rightly informed in the knowledge of thoſe holy Myſteries and that none that are either ignorant or ſcandalous in their lives, may be ſuffered to communicate at the Lord's Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by which their endeavour, they ſhew the chriſtian care they have of their eternall welfare (for which the people are ever bound unto them) and by the which alſo they take away all ſcandall &amp; occaſion of offence to others which formerly preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the cauſe of their ſeparating from our Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Aſſemblies was, in regard they could not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate with dogs and ſwine, and with the tagragge and bobtaile of all the Malignants; for in ſuch termes they uſually expreſſe themſelves.</p>
            <p>Now when the occaſion of this ſcandall and offence is taken away by the care of the Miniſters, and all ſuperſtition and popiſh ceremonies, and all will-worſhip is alſo rooted out, and when the Goſpell is truly and faithfully by them preached, both in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon, and the Name of God truly invocated and the Sacraments duly and rightly adminiſtred, what juſt cauſe have the Independents now either of ſeparation or of traducing either Miniſters or people of being enemies of Chriſt and his Kingdome, when by all their endeavours they onely ſeek the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of him and his Kingdome amongſt them? I have ſo good an opinion of all moderate minded chriſtians, that when they ſhall ſeriouſly weigh and conſider what I have here writ, and truly and faithfully ſet downe, that thoſe of them that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been alienated from them will again, being now undecei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, returne every one of them to their owne Paſtors, by whoſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:158510:86"/>miniſtries they have been converted; and that all other under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding men will not onely have more charitable thoughts both of the Miniſters and beleevers of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> but wil likewiſe look more narrowly into, and examine more diligently all thoſe new wayes, and by finding them out, to be indeed but new, will ſeek for the old way and walk in it, which ſhall ever be his prayer that wiſheth that all men may be ſaved, and come to the knowledge of the Truth.</p>
